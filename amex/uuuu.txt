	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This Annual Report and the exhibits attached hereto (the
	&#147;Annual Report
<B>
	&#148;
</B>
	) contain &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning
	of applicable US and Canadian securities laws. Such forward-looking statements
	concern Energy Fuels Inc.&#146;s (the &#147;Company&#146;s&#148; or &#147;Energy Fuels&#146;&#148;) anticipated
	results and progress of the Company&#146;s operations in future periods, planned
	exploration, and, if warranted, development of its properties, plans related to
	its business, and other matters that may occur in the future. These statements
	relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future
	results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of
	management.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect
	to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives,
	schedules, assumptions, future events, or performance (often, but not always,
	using words or phrases such as &#147;expects&#148; or &#147;does not expect&#148;, &#147;is expected&#148;,
	&#147;anticipates&#148; or &#147;does not anticipate&#148;, &#147;plans&#148;, &#147;estimates&#148; or &#147;intends&#148;, or
	stating that certain actions, events or results &#147;may&#148;, &#147;could&#148;, &#147;would&#148;, &#147;might&#148;
	or &#147;will&#148; be taken, occur or be achieved&#148;) are not statements of historical fact
	and may be forward-looking statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and
	estimates of management as of the date such statements are made. Energy Fuels
	believes that the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information are
	reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to
	be correct, and such forward-looking information included in, or incorporated by
	reference into, this Annual Report should not be unduly relied upon. This
	information speaks only as of the date of this Annual Report.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Readers are cautioned that it would be unreasonable to rely on
	any such forward-looking statements and information as creating any legal
	rights, and that the statements and information are not guarantees and may
	involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and that actual results are
	likely to differ (and may differ materially) and objectives and strategies may
	differ or change from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking
	statements or information as a result of various factors. Such risks and
	uncertainties include risks generally encountered in the exploration,
	development, operation, and closure of mineral properties and processing
	facilities. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and
	unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events
	or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
	statements, including, without limitation:

	This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect our

	could affect forward-looking statements are described further under the section
	headings: Item 1. Description of the Business; Item 1A. Risk Factors; and Item
	7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations of this Annual Report. Although we have attempted to identify
	important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
	those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that
	cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Should one or
	more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
	assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those
	anticipated, believed, estimated, or expected. We caution readers not to place
	undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
	the date made. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to
	subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
	circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of
	anticipated or unanticipated events. Statements relating to &#147;Mineral Reserves&#148;
	or &#147;Mineral Resources&#148; are deemed to be forward-looking information, as they
	involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and
	assumptions, that the Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources described may be
	profitably extracted in the future.

	This Annual Report contains certain disclosure that has been
	prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which
	differ from the requirements of United States&#146; securities laws. Unless otherwise
	indicated, all reserve and resource estimates included in this Annual Report,
	and in the documents incorporated by reference herein, have been prepared in
	accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 -
<I>
	Standards of Disclosure
	for Mineral Projects
</I>
	(&#147;
<B>
	NI 43-101
</B>
	&#148;) and the Canadian Institute of
	Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (
<B>
	&#147;CIM&#148;
</B>
	) classification system. NI 43-101
	is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators (the &#147;
<B>
	CSA
</B>
	&#148;)
	which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of
	scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly
	from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the &#147;
<B>
	SEC
</B>
	&#148;), and reserve and resource information contained herein, or
	incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, and in the documents
	incorporated by reference herein, may not be comparable to similar information
	disclosed by companies reporting under only United States standards. In
	particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term
	&#147;resource&#148; does not equate to the term &#147;reserve&#148; under SEC Industry Guide 7.
	Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a
	&#147;reserve&#148; unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could
	be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve
	determination is made. Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a &#147;final&#148; or
	&#147;bankable&#148; feasibility study is required to report reserves; the three-year
	historical average price, to the extent possible, is used in any reserve or cash
	flow analysis to designate reserves; and the primary environmental analysis or
	report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The SEC&#146;s disclosure standards under Industry Guide 7 normally
	do not permit the inclusion of information concerning &#147;Measured Mineral
	Resources&#148;, &#147;Indicated Mineral Resources&#148; or &#147;Inferred Mineral Resources&#148; or
	other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do
	not constitute &#147;reserves&#148; by United States standards in documents filed with the
	SEC. United States investors should also understand that &#147;Inferred Mineral
	Resources&#148; have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to
	their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part
	of an &#147;Inferred Mineral Resource&#148; will ever be upgraded to a higher category.
	Under Canadian rules, estimated &#147;Inferred Mineral Resources&#148; may not form the
	basis of feasibility or prefeasibility studies.
<B>
	United States investors are
	cautioned not to assume that all or any part of Measured or Indicated Mineral
	Resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. Investors are cautioned
	not to assume that all or any part of an &#147;Inferred Mineral Resource&#148; exists or
	is economically or legally mineable.
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Disclosure of &#147;contained pounds&#148; or &#147;contained ounces&#148; in a
	resource estimate is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however,
	the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not
	constitute &#147;reserves&#148; by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without
	reference to unit measures. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of
	&#147;reserves&#148; are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by
	the Company in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as &#147;reserves&#148; under SEC
	Industry Guide 7 standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits
	set forth herein may not be comparable to information made public by companies
	that report in accordance with United States standards.

<U>
	ISR Uranium Segment
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company conducts its ISR activities through its Nichols
	Ranch Project, located in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015
	through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (
<B>
	&#147;Uranerz&#148;
</B>
	). The
	Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing
	facility (the &#147;
<B>
	Nichols Ranch Plant
</B>
	&#148;); (ii) licensed and operating ISR
	wellfields (the &#147;

</B>
	), which will include an ISR
	processing plant (the

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Nichols Ranch Project is an operating ISR facility that
	recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using
	groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved
	within a deposit. The groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery
	wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a
	yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill, where it
	is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion
	facilities.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the
	elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced
	uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015,
	the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch
	Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. During 2015, a
	total of 273,000 pounds of U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	were recovered from the
	Nichols Ranch Project, of which approximately 172,000 pounds were recovered by
	the Company after its acquisition of Uranerz in June 2015.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Additionally, the Company announced on March 4, 2016 that it
	entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Meste&#241;a Uranium LLC, which
	includes additional ISR properties located in Brooks and Jim Hogg Counties,
	Texas, as described below in &#147;

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<U>
	Conventional Uranium Segment
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company conducts its conventional uranium extraction and
	recovery activities through its White Mesa Mill, which is the only operating
	conventional uranium mill in the United States. The White Mesa Mill, located
	near Blanding Utah, is centrally located such that it can be fed by a number of
	the Company&#146;s uranium and uranium/vanadium projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona
	and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchases or toll milling arrangements with
	third party miners in the region as market conditions warrant.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill is a 2,000 ton per day uranium recovery
	facility, which can also process vanadium as a co-product of mineralized
	material extracted from certain uranium/vanadium properties. In addition, the
	Mill can recycle other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional
	ore, referred to as "alternate feed materials", for the recovery of uranium,
	alone or in combination with other metals.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign
	basis, whereby mineral processing occurs as mill feed, contract requirements,
	and market conditions warrant. Over the years, the Company&#146;s own, and
	third-party owned, conventional uranium properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona
	and New Mexico have been both active and on standby, from time-to-time, in
	response to changing market conditions. From 2007 through 2014, running on a
	campaign basis, the White Mesa Mill recovered on average over 1 million pounds
	of&nbsp; U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	per year from conventional sources,
<SUP>
</SUP>
	including its La Sal Project, Daneros Project, and Tony M property in
	Utah; its Arizona 1 and Pinenut Projects in Arizona; and alternate feed
	materials. During 2015, the Mill recovered a total of 296,000 lbs. of&nbsp;
	U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	, of which 25,000 pounds were recovered from
	conventional materials and the remainder from processing alternate feed materials (including 72,000 pounds for the account of a third
	party). Between campaigns, the Mill is maintained on standby status, ready to
	resume mineral processing activities, as market conditions warrant.

	The Company&#146;s Pinenut Project, where mineral extraction
	activities occurred until September 2015, is now depleted, and reclamation
	activities have commenced. Approximately 43,000 tons of mineralized material
	extracted from the Pinenut Project is currently stockpiled at the White Mesa
	Mill. The Company is also continuing to receive and stockpile alternate feed
	materials at the White Mesa Mill for a future mineral processing campaign. At
	the Company&#146;s permitted Canyon Project, shaft-sinking activities are currently
	taking place. The Company expects to complete an underground drilling program at
	the Canyon Project during 2016. The timing to extract and process mineralized
	material from the Canyon Project will be based on the results of this additional
	evaluation work, along with market conditions, available financing, and sales
	requirements. All of the Company&#146;s other conventional properties and projects
	are currently in the permitting process or on standby pending improvements in
	market conditions. No third party conventional properties are active at this

	located in Wyoming in an advanced stage of permitting. Due to its distance from
	the White Mesa Mill, the Sheep Mountain Project is not expected to be a source
	of feed material for the Mill. The Sheep Mountain Project consists of open pit
	and underground extraction components (the

	Energy Fuels intends to continue to strengthen its position as
	a leading uranium extraction and recovery company focused on the United States.
	With the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company has added ISR recovery to our
	portfolio that, along with certain of the Company&#146;s conventional projects and
	alternate feed material processing at the White Mesa Mill, sit at the lower end
	of the Company&#146;s cost curve. With its large uranium resource base and existing
	conventional projects on standby, under construction, and in permitting, the
	Company&#146;s strategy is to remain a unique and valuable call option on increases
	in the price of uranium, with significant scalability in improved market
	conditions. The Company currently intends to maintain its ISR and conventional
	uranium recovery capabilities, uranium resource base, and scalability. However,
	continued weakness in uranium prices and cash needs dictate that the Company
	engage in further measures to maintain the value of this option. As a result, at
	this time we intend to conserve cash and focus on our lowest cost uranium
	sources of uranium recovery, as follows:

<UL STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY">

	Meste&#241;a is a well-known uranium recovery company that owns the Alta Mesa

	from six production areas. From November 2013 to the present, Meste&#241;a has
	maintained the Alta Mesa Project on standby in response to low uranium prices.
	The Alta Mesa Project is located on the Jones Ranch, which is approximately
	350,000 acres in size and located in Brooks and Jim Hogg Counties, Texas. The
	properties included within the project include over 195,000 acres covered by a
	Uranium Testing Permit and Lease Option Agreement (the &#147;

	operations. The Alta Mesa Project has a fully-licensed and constructed ISR
	plant, with a design capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium concentrate per
	year. There is an existing June 1, 2014 historical resource estimate for a
	portion of the properties, prepared by Douglas L. Beahm, P.E., P.G., that is not
	currently compliant with NI 43-101. This recent historical estimate shows that

	estimate of mineral resources or mineral reserves, and as such the Company is
	not treating it as a current estimate of mineral reserves or mineral resources.
	However, the Company believes the estimate is relevant and reliable, as it was
	prepared within the last two years by a reputable mining consultant. In order to
	upgrade and verify this historical estimate and classify it as a current mineral
	resource estimate, the Company needs to perform further evaluations of the
	report and confirm that its underlying assumptions continue to be reasonable and
	that the report is complete and current. The Company expects to perform this evaluation and update the historical report to a NI 43-101
	compliant technical report, which is expected to be filed on the System for
	Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (&#147;

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Prior to the Uranerz acquisition in June of 2015, the Company
	was engaged solely in conventional uranium exploration, permitting, extraction,
	and recovery. The Company&#146;s source of conventional uranium recovery is the White
	Mesa Mill, which generates revenue through conventional processing, alternate
	feed material processing, and toll processing agreements (the
<B>
	&#147;Conventional
	Uranium Segment&#148;
</B>
	). The nature of the Company&#146;s business expanded with the
	addition of ISR facilities when the Company acquired Uranerz (the
<B>
	&#147;ISR
	Uranium Segment&#148;
</B>
	). Although the principal product of both segments is
	uranium concentrate, or &#147;yellowcake,&#148; the methods of extraction and recovery
	differ. In addition, the Conventional Uranium Segment provides services at the
	White Mesa Mill, namely alternate feed material processing and toll processing,
	which the Company&#146;s ISR Uranium Segment does not provide.

	According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (
<B>
	&#147;NEI&#148;
</B>
	), in
	2012 nuclear power plants provided about 11% of global electricity production.
	According to the World Nuclear Association (
<B>
	&#147;WNA&#148;
</B>
	), as of March 1, 2016,
	there are currently 440 operable reactors world-wide, which require

	fuel per year at

	with an additional 173 reactors on order, or in the planning stage and another
	337 which have been proposed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	According to data from TradeTech LLC (
<B>
	&#147;TradeTech&#148;
</B>
	), the
	world continues to require more uranium than it produces from primary
	extraction, largely due to increasing uranium demands in Asia. The gap between
	demand and primary supply has been filled by stockpiled inventories and
	secondary supplies.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	According to the WNA, the United States currently has 99
	operating reactors, five reactors under construction, and another 42 reactors on
	order, planned or proposed. According to the NEI, the United States produced
	approximately 19.5% of its electricity from nuclear technology in 2014.
	According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (
<B>
	&#147;EIA&#148;
</B>
	), U.S. utilities
	purchased approximately 53.3 million pounds of U

</SUB>
	in
	2014. However, the U.S. only

	produced approximately 4.9 million pounds
	(9%). As a result, in 2014, the U.S. filled about 91% of its demand from foreign

	approximately 3.3 million pounds.

	Uranium is not traded on an open market or organized commodity
	exchange such as the London Metal Exchange, although the New York Mercantile
	Exchange provides financially-settled uranium futures contracts. Typically,
	buyers and sellers negotiate transactions privately and directly. Spot uranium
	transactions typically involve deliveries that occur immediately and up to 12
	months in the future. Term uranium transactions typically involve deliveries
	that occur more than 12 months in the future, with long-term transactions
	involving delivery terms of at least three years. Uranium prices, both spot
	prices and term prices, are published by two independent market consulting
	firms, TradeTech and The Ux Consulting Company (
<B>
	&#147;Ux&#148;
</B>
	), on a weekly and
	monthly basis.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The spot and term prices of uranium are influenced by a number
	of global factors. For example, both the spot and term prices of uranium were
	impacted by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant in March 2011.
	The events at Fukushima created heightened concerns regarding the safety of
	nuclear plants and led to both temporary and permanent closures of nuclear
	plants around the world. The Fukushima incident has created downward pressure on
	uranium prices over the past five years, which is still being felt today.
	Alternatively, China is pursuing an aggressive nuclear program, with 30 units
	now operating, 24 new units under construction, 42 units which are planned, and
	178 units that have been proposed, according to the WNA.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Historically, most nuclear utilities have sought to purchase a
	portion of their uranium needs through long-term supply contracts, while other
	portions are bought on the spot market. Like sellers, buyers seek to balance the
	security of long term supply with the opportunity to take advantage of lower
	prices caused by volatility in prices. For this reason, both buyers and sellers
	track current spot and long-term prices for uranium carefully, make considered
	projections as to future prices, and negotiate with one another on transactions
	which each deems favorable to their respective interests. According to data from
	Ux, levels of long-term contracting in 2013, 2014 and 2015 were well below
	historical averages.

	prices began 2015 at $50.00 per pound and ended 2015

	persisted through the end of the year. The high long-term price for 2015 was
	$50.00 per pound. The Company believes the weak uranium markets are the result
	of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of secondary uranium
	extraction and excess inventories, the availability of low-priced spot material,
	the delayed restart of Japanese reactors, insufficient cut-backs, premature
	reactor closures, continued weak uranium demand, and general weakness in the

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	World demand for clean, reliable, and affordable baseload
	electricity is growing. As a result of the expected growth of nuclear energy,
	the Company believes the long-term fundamentals of the uranium industry are
	positive. The Company believes prices must rise to higher levels to support
	the new primary production that will be required to meet the increasing demand
	we expect to see as more nuclear units are constructed around the world.
	According to TradeTech, world uranium requirements exceed primary mine
	production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess uranium
	inventories in various forms that have already been mined. As excess inventories
	are drawn down and as production from existing mines drops, the Company believes
	primary mine production will be required to meet demand over the long-term.
	According to data from Ux, long-term contracting levels in 2013, 2014 and 2015
	have been low by historical standards. The Company believes uranium prices, and
	long-term contracting levels in particular, will need to rise to levels that are
	sufficient to incentivize new mine production. Even if prices rise to these
	levels, it may be difficult for suppliers to respond in a timely manner, as it
	typically requires many years of permitting and development to bring new mines
	into production. The Company expects these permitting and development lead times
	to put further pressure on prices to increase.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Despite current market uncertainty and recently falling prices,
	the Company believes it has begun to see certain early signs of a market
	recovery. Japanese utilities have begun to restart their reactor fleet (Reuters,
	August 11, 2015). According to data from TradeTech and the WNA, Chinese
	utilities continue to aggressively build new reactors and buy uranium. According
	to TradeTech, the growth of Kazakh uranium production has slowed significantly
	over the past three years, and is not expected to increase significantly in the
	coming years. And, in addition to China, according to the WNA, there are large
	numbers of new reactors under construction and in various stages of planning
	around the world.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	However in the short- and medium-terms, market challenges
	remain. The world continues to be oversupplied with uranium, mainly due to large
	quantities of secondary and other inelastic uranium supplies (including enricher
	underfeeding), high levels of excess inventories, insufficient producer
	cut-backs, premature reactor shutdowns, delays in new reactor construction, two
	large new mines coming into production (Cigar Lake and Husab), and decreased
	demand due to Japanese reactors remaining offline for longer than expected. In
	addition, there is a great deal of uncertainty in uranium prices regarding the
	timing and level of the recovery, as fundamental, political, technical, and
	other factors could cause prices to be significantly above or below currently
	expected ranges.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Nevertheless, according to data from Ux, global utilities have
	significant uncovered uranium requirements over the next 10 years, which the
	Company expects will increase levels of market activity in the short- and
	medium-terms.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s marketing strategy is to seek a base of earnings
	and cash flow through sales of a portion of its uranium into term contracts. To
	gain exposure to increasing uranium prices, the Company seeks to sell a portion
	of its planned uranium extraction into contracts with market-related formulas
	(when available) and through future spot and term sales. Further exposure to
	increasing uranium prices can be generated through the Company&#146;s ability to
	bring additional uranium extraction online in the future in response to
	increasing prices, which can be sold on a market-related or fixed basis at then
	prevailing prices. The Company&#146;s current existing term contracts utilize
	market-related formulas with base, floor and ceiling prices, some of which are
	escalated at the rate of inflation. During 2015, the pricing on all of the
	Company&#146;s term contracts were at their floors or at prices fixed by the
	contract. Under the Company&#146;s contracts, the Company sold 1,025,000 pounds of
	U
<SUB>

<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	at a weighted- average price
<SUP>
</SUP>
	of $57.41 per

	price of $37.35 per pound. In 2016, the Company expects to sell a total of
	550,000 pounds of U

</SUB>
	O
<SUB>

</SUB>
	into its four existing contracts at

	price inflation. Selective spot sales are also expected to be made in 2016 as
	necessary to generate cash for operations, construction and resource evaluation
	activities, including continued shaft-sinking and evaluation at the Canyon

	The Vanadium Market
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill has historically recovered vanadium as a
	co-product of uranium from certain of its properties on the Colorado Plateau,
	most notably from the La Sal Project, as well as from properties owned by
	third-parties on the Colorado Plateau through toll milling and similar

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	According to the market consultant TTP Squared, Inc.
	(
<B>
	&#147;TTP&#148;
</B>
	), the vast majority of vanadium is used in the production of high
	strength steels (approximately 93%). 3% is used in titanium alloys in aerospace
	and other applications, and another 4% is used in catalyst and chemical
	applications. Today, while only a minor quantity of vanadium is used in energy storage applications, there is
	potential for greatly expanded use of vanadium in emerging battery
	technologies.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	According to data from the Vanadium International Technical
	Committee compiled by TTP, vanadium consumption in 2014 is estimated to have
	been in excess of 92,000 metric tons. However, as the demand for high strength,
	high performance steels increases, and as new uses are developed for
	lightweight, high strength titanium alloys, vanadium demand can be expected to
	increase at a faster rate than the growth of global steel production. The
	average vanadium content in steel in developing countries is much lower than the
	ratios in the developed countries and can be expected to increase, adding to the
	demand. If high-capacity batteries using vanadium are commercialized, demand can
	be expected to increase further. The Company believes the future prospects for
	vanadium are highly dependent on continued growth in China.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While demand is expected to grow over time, supply likely has
	the capacity to increase to meet this demand. Most vanadium is recovered as a
	byproduct or coproduct of other processes. Many primary producers, in countries
	such as China, Russia and South Africa, have been shut down due to low prices.
	Extraction of vanadium from steel making slag has been cut back or halted. As
	demand increases and prices strengthen, some of these facilities can be expected
	to restart or increase production, thus moderating any anticipated price
	increases.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While long-term demand for vanadium can be expected to
	increase, it is unknown whether future prices for vanadium will increase due to
	the relatively high number of low-cost suppliers who may re-enter the market as

	Competition
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The uranium industry is highly competitive. The Company
	competes with mining and exploration companies for uranium sales, the
	acquisition of uranium mineral properties, and the procurement of equipment,
	materials and personnel necessary to explore, develop, and extract uranium from
	such properties. There is competition for a limited number of uranium
	acquisition opportunities, including competition with other companies having
	substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than the
	Company. As a result, the Company may encounter challenges in acquiring
	attractive properties, and exploring and advancing properties currently in the
	Company&#146;s portfolio. In addition, Energy Fuels competes with other uranium
	recovery companies, along with traders, brokers, financial institutions,
	converters, enrichers, and other market actors, for uranium sales. Due to the
	Company&#146;s limited capital and personnel and the relative size of its operations,
	the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to some other
	companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, development of mining
	properties and securing uranium sales. The Company believes that competition for
	acquiring mineral prospects and completing uranium sales will continue to be
	intense in the future.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The availability of funds for exploration, evaluation,
	permitting and construction of uranium projects is limited, and the Company may
	find it difficult to compete with larger and more established uranium
	exploration and production companies for capital. The Company&#146;s inability to
	continue exploration, advancement, and the acquisition of new properties due to
	lack of funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s future

	On August 16, 2004, the State of Utah became an Agreement State
	for the regulation of uranium mills. This means that the primary regulator for
	the White Mesa Mill is now the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality
	(&#147;
<B>
	UDEQ
</B>
	&#148;) rather than the NRC. At that time, the Mill&#146;s NRC Source
	Material License was transferred to the State of Utah and became a Radioactive
	Materials License. The State of Utah incorporates, through its own regulations
	or by reference, all aspects of Title 10 pertaining to uranium recovery

	&#148;) be put in place for the White Mesa
	Mill. The GWDP is required for all similar facilities in the State of Utah, and
	specifically tailors the implementation of the state groundwater regulations to
	the Mill site. The State of Utah requires that every operating uranium mill have
	a GWDP, regardless of whether or not the facility discharges to groundwater. The
	GWDP for the Mill was finalized and implemented in March 2005. The White Mesa
	Mill also maintains a permit approval for air emissions with the UDEQ, Division

	On July 9, 2009, BLM issued a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal
	(
<B>
	&#147;2009 Notice&#148;
</B>
	) under which it proposed that a total of approximately one
	million acres of public lands around the Grand Canyon National Park be withdrawn
	from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 (the
<B>
	&#147;Mining Law&#148;
</B>
	),
	subject to valid existing rights. In the 2009 Notice, BLM stated that the
	purpose of the withdrawal, if determined to be appropriate, would be to protect
	the Grand Canyon watershed from any adverse effects of locatable hardrock
	mineral exploration and mining. The 2009 Notice segregated the lands from
	location and entry under the mining laws for up to two years to allow time for
	various studies and analyses, including appropriate NEPA analysis. In order to
	allow more time for BLM to complete its NEPA analysis, the U.S. Department of
	the Interior (the
<B>
	&#147;DOI&#148;
</B>
	) published Public Land Order 7773 on June 21,
	2011, which affected a six-month emergency withdrawal of the area. The emergency
	withdrawal prevented the lands from opening to location and entry under the
	Mining Law upon expiration of the two-year segregation while the DOI completed
	the decision&#150;making process on the proposed withdrawal. The emergency withdrawal
	was effective July 21, 2011 to January 20, 2012. During the two-year segregation
	and six month emergency withdrawal, the BLM, along with its cooperating
	agencies, completed various studies and analyses of resources in the withdrawal
	area, including an EIS under NEPA. These studies and analyses were undertaken to
	provide the basis for the final decision regarding whether or not to proceed
	with the proposed withdrawal or to select an alternative action. Based on this
	analysis, on January 9, 2012, the DOI announced its final decision to withdraw
	from location and entry under the Mining Law, subject to valid existing rights,
	the total of approximately one million acres of lands originally proposed in the
	2009 Notice (the
<B>
	&#147;Withdrawn Lands&#148;
</B>
	), for a 20-year period. Lawsuits
	challenging this decision have been filed by various industry groups and
	interested parties.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	No new mining claims may be filed on the Withdrawn Lands and no
	new Plans of Operations may be approved, other than Plans of Operations on
	mining claims that were valid at the time of withdrawal and that remain valid at
	the time of plan approval. Whether or not a mining claim is valid must be
	determined by a mineral examination conducted by BLM or USFS, as applicable. The
	mineral examination, which involves an economic evaluation of a project, must
	demonstrate the existence of a locatable mineral resource and that the mineral
	resource constitutes the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit.

	All of the Company&#146;s properties located on the Arizona Strip,
	with the exception of its Wate property and certain exploration properties held
	by the Company&#146;s subsidiary, Arizona Strip Partners LLC, are located within the
	Withdrawn Lands. A mineral examination on the Company&#146;s EZ Project will need to
	be completed by BLM, in conjunction with its review of the Company&#146;s proposed
	Plan of Operations for that project. Mineral examinations were not required for
	the Company&#146;s Arizona 1 and Pinenut projects, which had previously approved
	Plans of Operations and were recently active. Although the Company&#146;s Canyon
	Project also has an approved Plan of Operation, and a mineral examination is not
	required, the USFS performed a mineral examination on that project in 2012 and
	concluded that the Canyon Project&#146;s claims constitute valid existing rights. The
	USFS also concluded that no additional approvals are required on the Canyon
	Project.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company believes that all of its material projects within
	the Withdrawn Lands are on valid mining claims that will each withstand a
	mineral examination. However, market conditions may postpone or prevent the
	performance of mineral examinations on certain properties and, if a mineral
	examination is performed on a property, there can be no guarantee that the
	mineral examination would not result in one of more of the Company&#146;s mining
	claims being considered invalid, which could prevent a project from
	proceeding.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In addition, there are efforts underway that have the potential
	to create a National Monument on the Withdrawn Lands, and additional lands, near
	the Grand Canyon National Park. These efforts include proposed legislation which has been
	introduced in Congress and lobbying of the President of the United States to
	create a National Monument utilizing his executive powers under the Antiquities
	Act of 1906. All of the Company&#146;s projects, except the Wate Project, are located on lands which have the potential to be included in a
	National Monument. If such a National Monument is created, there is the
	potential that these projects could become subject to additional requirements and/or
	costs, or be prevented from proceeding.

	Our results of operations are significantly affected by
	the market price of uranium and vanadium which are cyclical and subject to
	substantial price fluctuations.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our earnings and operating cash flow are and will be
	particularly sensitive to the long and short term changes in the market price of
	uranium and vanadium. Among other factors, these prices also affect the value of
	our resources, reserves, and inventories, as well as the market price of our
	Common Shares.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Market prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our
	control. With respect to uranium, such factors include, among others: demand for
	nuclear power; political and economic conditions in uranium producing and
	consuming countries; public and political response to a nuclear incident;
	reprocessing of used reactor fuel, the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails
	and the enricher practice of underfeeding; sales of excess civilian and military
	inventories (including from the dismantling of nuclear weapons; the premature
	decommissioning of nuclear power plants; and from the build-up of Japanese
	utility uranium inventories as a result of the Fukushima incident) by
	governments and industry participants; uranium supply, including the supply from
	other secondary sources; and production levels and costs of production. With
	respect to vanadium, such factors include, among others: demand for steel; the
	potential for vanadium to be used in advanced battery technologies; political
	and economic conditions in vanadium producing and consuming countries; world
	production levels; and costs of production. Other factors relating to both the
	price of uranium and vanadium include: levels of supply and demand for a broad
	range of industrial products; substitution of new or different products in
	critical applications for our existing products; expectations with respect to
	the rate of inflation; the relative strength of the US dollar and of certain
	other currencies; interest rates; global or regional political or economic
	crises; regional and global economic conditions; and sales of uranium and
	vanadium by holders in response to such factors. If prices are below our cash
	costs of extraction or recovery and remain at such levels for any sustained
	period, we may determine that it is not economically feasible to continue
	commercial extraction or recovery at any or all of our projects or other
	facilities and may also be required to look for alternatives other than cash
	flow to maintain our liquidity until prices recover. Our expected levels of
	uranium recovery and business activity are dependent on our expectation and the
	industry&#146;s expectations of uranium and vanadium prices, which may not be
	realized or may change. In the event we conclude that a significant
	deterioration in expected future uranium prices has occurred, we will assess
	whether an impairment allowance is necessary which, if required, could be
	material.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The recent fluctuations in the price of many commodities is an
	example of a situation over which we have no control and which could materially
	adversely affect us in a manner for which we may not be able to compensate.
	There can be no assurance that the price of any minerals recovered from our
	properties will be such that any deposits can be operated at a profit.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our profitability is directly related to the market price of
	uranium and vanadium recovered. We may from time to time undertake commodity and
	currency hedging programs, with the intention of maintaining adequate cash flows
	and profitability to contribute to the long term viability of the business. We
	anticipate selling forward in the ordinary course of business if, and when, we
	have sufficient assets and recovery to support forward sale arrangements. There
	are, however, risks associated with forward sale programs. If we do not have
	sufficient recovered uranium to meet our forward sale commitments, we may have
	to buy or borrow (for later delivery back from recovered uranium) sufficient
	uranium in the spot market to deliver under the forward sales contracts,
	possibly at higher prices than provided for in the forward sales contracts, or
	potentially default on such deliveries. In addition, under forward contracts, we
	may be forced to sell at prices that are lower than the prices that may be
	available on the spot market when such deliveries are completed. Although we may
	employ various pricing mechanisms within our sales contracts to manage our

	above. At
	current uranium and vanadium prices, a number of our properties, projects, and
	facilities are not economic for uranium, and for some properties uranium and/or
	vanadium, extraction, recovery, or processing. We intend to continue to hold,

	increase to the levels required to advance those properties or, in the case of
	projects or facilities on standby, to resume exploration, extraction, recovery,
	or processing activities at those projects or facilities. We continue to hold
	such properties, projects, and facilities because we believe that uranium and/or
	vanadium prices are likely to rise to such levels within a reasonable time
	period, and the ability to maintain scalability as commodity prices increase is
	a key component of our business strategy. However, as there is a cost associated
	with holding and in some cases maintaining on standby such properties, projects,
	or facilities, we continuously evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, such costs
	against the prospects for price increases, and may from time to time sell, drop

	to receive and stockpile alternate feed materials for future milling campaigns.
	Each future milling campaign will be subject to receipt of sufficient mill feed

	caused deterioration in the global economy, as numerous commercial and financial
	enterprises either went into bankruptcy or creditor protection or had to be

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Securities of mining companies have experienced substantial
	volatility and downward pressure in the recent past, often based on factors
	unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved.
	These factors include macroeconomic conditions in North America and globally,
	and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. The price
	of our securities is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term
	changes in uranium and vanadium prices, changes in industry forecasts of uranium
	and vanadium prices, other mineral prices including oil and natural gas,
	currency exchange fluctuation, or in our financial condition or results of
	operations as reflected in our periodic earnings reports. Other factors
	unrelated to our performance that may have an effect on the price of our
	securities include the following: the extent of research coverage available to
	investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with
	research capabilities do not follow our securities; lessening in trading volume
	and general market interest in our securities may affect an investor's ability
	to trade significant numbers of our securities; the size of our public float and
	the exclusion from market indices may limit the ability of some institutions to
	invest in our securities; and a substantial decline in the price of our
	securities that persists for a significant period of time could cause our
	securities to be delisted from an exchange, further reducing market liquidity.
	Our exclusion from certain market indices may reduce market liquidity or the
	price of our securities. If an active market for our securities does not
	continue, the liquidity of an investor's investment may be limited and the price
	of our securities may decline. If an active market does not exist, investors may
	lose their entire investment. As a result of any of these factors, the market
	price of our securities at any given point in time may not accurately reflect
	our long-term value. Securities class-action litigation often has been brought
	against companies in periods of volatility in the market price of their
	securities, and following major corporate transactions or mergers and

	Sustained lower prices of oil, natural gas, coal and hydroelectricity may result

	developed into producing mines or extraction or recovery facilities. Major

	Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends
	on a number of factors, which include, among other things: the accuracy of
	resource and reserve estimates; the particular attributes of the deposit, such
	as its size, geology and grade; the ability to economically recover commercial
	quantities of the minerals; proximity to infrastructure and availability of
	personnel; financing costs; governmental regulations, including regulations
	relating to prices, taxes, royalties; the potential for litigation; land use;
	importing and exporting; and environmental and cultural protection. The
	construction, development, expansion and restarting of projects are also subject
	to the successful completion of engineering studies, the issuance of necessary
	governmental permits, the availability of adequate financing, and that
	engineering and construction timetables and capital costs are correctly
	estimated for our projects, including restarting projects on standby, and such
	construction timetables and capital costs are not affected by unforeseen

	It is possible that actual costs and economic returns of

	Mineral reserves and resources are statistical estimates of
	mineral content, based on limited information acquired through drilling and
	other sampling methods, and require judgmental interpretations of geology.
	Successful extraction requires safe and efficient mining and processing. Our
	mineral reserves and resources are estimates, and no assurance can be given that
	the estimated reserves and resources are accurate or that the indicated level of
	uranium or vanadium will be produced economically or otherwise. Such estimates
	are, in large part, based on interpretations of geological data obtained from
	drill holes and other sampling techniques. Actual mineralization or formations
	may be different from those predicted. Further, it may take many years from the
	initial phase of drilling before production is possible, and during that time
	the economic feasibility of exploiting a discovery may change.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Mineral reserve and resource estimates for properties that have
	not commenced extraction, production or recovery are based, in many instances,
	on limited and widely spaced drill-hole information, which is not necessarily
	indicative of the conditions between and around drill holes. Accordingly, such
	mineral resource and reserve estimates may require revision as more drilling
	information becomes available or as actual extraction, production or recovery
	experience is gained. It should not be assumed that all or any part of our
	mineral resources constitute, or will be converted into, reserves. Market price
	fluctuations of uranium or vanadium as applicable, as well as increased
	production and capital costs or reduced recovery rates, may render our proven
	and probable reserves unprofitable to develop at a particular site or sites for

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our operations and activities are subject to all of the hazards
	and risks normally incidental to exploration, construction, development,
	extraction and mining of mineral properties, and recovery, processing and
	milling, including: environmental hazards; industrial accidents; labor disputes,
	disturbances and unavailability of skilled labor; encountering unusual or
	unexpected geologic formations; rock bursts, pressures, cave-ins, flooding;
	periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions;
	technological and processing problems, including unanticipated metallurgical
	difficulties, ground control problems, process upsets and equipment
	malfunctions; the availability and/or fluctuations in the costs of raw materials
	and consumables used in our production and recovery processes; the ability to
	procure mining and other equipment and operating and other supplies in
	sufficient quantities and on a timely basis; and other extraction, mining,
	recovery, milling, and processing risks, as well as risks associated with our
	dependence on third parties in the provision of transportation and other
	critical services. Many of the foregoing risks and hazards could result in
	damage to, or destruction of, our mineral properties or processing or recovery
	facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or
	interruption of or cessation of extraction, mining, production and recovery from
	our mines or processing facilities or in our exploration, construction or
	development activities, delay in or inability to receive regulatory approvals to
	transport our uranium concentrates, or costs, monetary losses and potential
	legal liability and adverse governmental action. In addition, due to the
	radioactive nature of the materials handled in uranium extraction, mining,
	recovery, and processing, additional costs and risks are incurred by us on a
	regular and ongoing basis.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While we may obtain insurance against certain risks in such
	amounts as we consider adequate, the nature of these risks are such that
	liabilities could exceed policy limits or could be excluded from coverage. There
	are also risks against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not
	to insure. The potential costs which could be associated with any liabilities
	not covered by insurance or in excess of insurance coverage or compliance with
	applicable laws and regulations may cause substantial delays and require
	significant capital outlays, adversely affecting our future earnings, financial
	position and competitive position. No assurance can be given that such insurance
	will continue to be available or will be available at economically feasible
	premiums or that it will provide sufficient coverage for losses related to these
	or other risks and hazards. This lack of insurance coverage could result in
	material economic harm to us.

	Our material mineral resources are located at the Nichols Ranch
	Project, the Canyon Project, the Roca Honda Project, the Sheep Mountain Project,
	the Henry Mountains Complex, the La Sal Project, and the Daneros Project. These projects are our primary sources (and potential sources)
	of current and future uranium concentrates. Unless other mineral resources or
	reserves are discovered or extensions to existing resource bodies are found, our
	sources of extraction, production and recovery for uranium concentrates will
	decrease over time as our current mineral resources are depleted. There can be
	no assurance that our future exploration, construction, development and
	acquisition efforts will be successful in replenishing our mineral resources or
	finding or developing reserves. In addition, while we believe that many of our
	properties will eventually engage in extraction or mining activities, there can
	be no assurance that they will be placed into such activities, or that they will
	be able to replace current extraction or mining activities.

	Internal controls over financial reporting are procedures

	communicated to a company&#146;s management, including its chief executive officer

	Because the probability of an individual prospect ever

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have no reserves as defined by SEC Industry Guide 7, and our
	Nichols Ranch Project only recently commenced generating revenue from
	operations. Because the probability of an individual prospect ever having
	reserves is uncertain, our properties may not contain any reserves, and any
	funds spent on exploration, construction, development, extraction, and recovery
	may be lost. We do not know with certainty that economically recoverable uranium
	exists on any of our properties as defined by SEC Industry Guide 7. Further,
	although we have commenced uranium extraction activities at our Nichols Ranch
	Project, our lack of established reserves means that we are uncertain as to our
	ability to continue to generate revenue from our operations. We may never
	discover uranium in commercially exploitable quantities and any identified
	deposit may never qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) reserve. We
	will continue to attempt to acquire the surface and mineral rights on lands that
	we think are geologically favorable or where we have historical information in
	our possession that indicates uranium mineralization might be present.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The exploration and, if warranted, construction relating to or
	development of mineral deposits involves significant financial and other risks
	over an extended period of time, which even a combination of careful evaluation,
	experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Few properties which are explored
	are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenditures are required
	to establish reserves by drilling and to construct mining and processing
	facilities at a site. Our uranium properties are all classified under SEC
	Industry Guide 7 to be at the exploration stage and do not contain any reserves
	at this time. It is impossible to ensure that the current or proposed
	exploration programs and other activities on properties in which we have an
	interest will result in the delineation of mineral reserves or in profitable
	commercial operations. Our operations and activities are subject to the hazards
	and risks normally incident to exploration and production of uranium, precious
	and base metals, any of which could result in damage to life or property,
	environmental damage and possible legal liability for such damage. While we may
	obtain insurance against certain risks, the nature of these risks is such that
	liabilities could exceed policy limits or could be excluded from coverage. There
	are also risks against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not
	to insure. The potential costs which could be associated with any liabilities
	not covered by insurance, or in excess of insurance coverage, or compliance with
	applicable laws and regulations may cause substantial delays and require
	significant capital outlays, adversely affecting our future earnings and
	competitive position and, potentially our financial viability.

	If the Company becomes a &#145;&#145;passive foreign investment

	&#148;) for any year during a
	U.S. Holder's holding period, then certain potentially adverse rules would
	affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder resulting from
	the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Company's securities. The Company believes that it was not a PFIC during
	the prior tax year ended on December 31, 2015, and based on current business
	plans and financial expectations, the Company expects that it will not be a PFIC
	for the current tax year and expects that it will not be a PFIC for the foreseeable future. No opinion of legal
	counsel or ruling from the IRS concerning the status of the Company as a PFIC
	has been obtained or is currently planned to be requested. PFIC classification
	is fundamentally factual in nature, generally cannot be determined until the
	close of the tax year in question, and is determined annually. Additionally, the
	analysis depends, in part, on the application of complex U.S. federal income tax
	rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. Consequently, there can
	be no assurance that the Company has never been, is not, and will not become a
	PFIC for any tax year during which U.S. Holders hold the Company's securities.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In addition, in any year in which the Company is classified as
	a PFIC, U.S. Holders will be required to file an annual report with the IRS
	containing such information as Treasury Regulations and/or other IRS guidance
	may require. In addition to penalties, a failure to satisfy such reporting
	requirements may result in an extension of the time period during which the IRS
	can assess a tax. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding
	the requirements of filing such information returns under these rules, including
	the requirement to file an IRS Form 8621.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company will be a PFIC under
	Section 1297 of the Code if, for a tax year, (a) 75% or more of the gross income
	of the Company for such tax year is passive income (the &#147;
<B>
	income test
</B>
	&#148;) or
	(b) 50% or more of the value of the Company's assets either produce passive
	income or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;
<B>
	asset
	test
</B>
	&#148;), based on the quarterly average of the fair market value of such
	assets. &#147;
<B>
	Gross income
</B>
	&#148; generally includes all sales revenues less the
	cost of goods sold, plus income from investments and from incidental or outside
	operations or sources, and "passive income" generally includes, for example,
	dividends, interest, certain rents and royalties, certain gains from the sale of
	stock and securities, and certain gains from commodities transactions. In
	addition, for purposes of the PFIC income test and asset test described above,
	if the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the total value of
	the outstanding shares of another corporation, the Company will be treated as if
	it (a) held a proportionate share of the assets of such other corporation and
	(b) received directly a proportionate share of the income of such other
	corporation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under certain attribution rules, if the Company is a PFIC, U.S.
	Holders will be deemed to own their proportionate share of any subsidiary of the
	Company which is also a PFIC (a &#147;
<B>
	Subsidiary PFIC
</B>
	&#148;), and will be subject
	to U.S. federal income tax on (i) a distribution on the shares of a Subsidiary
	PFIC or (ii) a disposition of shares of a Subsidiary PFIC, both as if the holder
	directly held the shares of such Subsidiary PFIC.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If the Company were a PFIC in any tax year and a U.S. Holder
	held the Company's securities, such holder
	generally would be subject to special rules under Section 1291 of the Code with
	respect to "excess distributions" made by the Company on said securities and with respect to gain from the disposition of
	said securities. An &#147;excess distribution&#148;
	generally is defined as the excess of distributions with respect to securities
	of the Company, received by a U.S Holder in any tax year over
	125% of the average annual distributions such U.S. Holder has received from the
	Company during the shorter of the three preceding tax years, or such U.S.
	Holder's holding period for the securities, as
	applicable. Generally, a U.S. Holder would be required to allocate any excess
	distribution or gain from the disposition of the securities ratably over its holding period for the
	securities. Such amounts allocated to the
	year of the disposition or excess distribution would be taxed as ordinary
	income, and amounts allocated to prior tax years would be taxed as ordinary
	income at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year and an interest
	charge at a rate applicable to underpayments of tax would apply.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While there are U.S. federal income tax elections that
	sometimes can be made to mitigate these adverse tax consequences (including,
	without limitation, the &#147;
<B>
	QEF Election
</B>
	"&#148; under Section 1295 of the Code
	and the &#147;
<B>
	Mark-to-Market Election
</B>
	&#148; under Section 1296 of the Code), such
	elections are available in limited circumstances and must be made in a timely
	manner. Under proposed Treasury Regulations, if a U.S. Holder has an option,
	warrant, or other right to acquire stock of a PFIC, such
	option, warrant or right is considered to be PFIC stock subject to the default
	rules of Section 1291 of the Code that apply to "excess distributions" and
	dispositions described above. However, under the proposed Treasury Regulations,
	for the purposes of the PFIC rules, the holding period for any shares
	acquired upon the exercise of such an option, warrant or right will begin on the date a U.S. Holder
	acquires the underlying security (and not the date the securities are exercised). This
	will impact the availability, and consequences, of the QEF Election and
	Mark-to-Market Election with respect to the shares issued on exercise of the
	option, warrant or right. Holders should consult
	their own tax advisers regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to
	the ownership and disposition of Company securities, and the availability of certain U.S. tax elections under the PFIC rules.

	conventional uranium mill in the United States. The White Mesa Mill, located
	near Blanding Utah, is centrally located such that it can be fed by a number of
	the Company&#146;s uranium and uranium/vanadium projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona
	and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchase or toll milling arrangements with
	third party miners in the region, as market conditions warrant. The Company also
	owns the Sheep Mountain Project in Wyoming, which is a conventional uranium
	project in an advanced stage of permitting. Due to its distance from the White
	Mesa Mill, the Sheep Mountain Project is not expected to be a source of feed
	material for the Mill. The Sheep Mountain Project consists of the Sheep Mountain
	Extraction Operation and the proposed Sheep Mountain Processing Operation.

	Uranium recovery commenced at the Nichols Ranch Project

	The following table shows the extraction history from 2011 to
	December 31, 2015 from the mineral properties currently owned by the Company.
	Much of the material was stockpiled at the White Mesa Mill for a year or more
	before being processed. Since mineralized material is processed on a continuing
	basis during a Mill run and remains in-circuit for a considerable time mixed
	with all other mill feed, it is not possible to tie uranium and vanadium
	recovery to each project; therefore, pounds of extracted uranium and vanadium
	are not included in this table, except for the Nichols Ranch Project where
	annual extraction can be tracked.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Richard White, CPG#08792, the Company&#146;s Chief Geologist, is
	responsible for the disclosure of scientific or technical information concerning
	mineral projects in this Annual Report.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following tables show the Company's estimate of Mineral
	Reserves and Mineral Resources as of December 31, 2015. NI 43-101 requires
	mineral companies to disclose Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources using the
	subcategories of Proven Mineral Reserves, Probable Mineral Reserves, Measured
	Mineral Resources, Indicated Mineral Resources and Inferred Mineral Resources.
	Energy Fuels reports Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources separately.
	Properties sold or otherwise disposed of during 2015 are not included in the
	table. These properties include the Marquez and Nose Rock properties. Except as
	stated below, the Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource information shown below
	is as reported in the various technical reports prepared in accordance with NI
	43-101 (the
<B>
	&#147;Technical Reports&#148;
</B>
	) by qualified persons employed by Peter
	Geosciences, BRS Engineering, Chlumsky, Armbrust, and Meyer, SRK Consulting (US)
	Inc., and Roscoe Postle Associates Inc.
<I>
	See &#147;Mineral Projects&#148; below.
</I>
	The
	table below also reflects the Company&#146;s adjustments to the resources as of
	December 31, 2015 at the properties where exploration and well installation
	drilling and/or extraction were in progress in 2015; notably at the Nichols
	Ranch Project. The Pinenut Project has been removed from the table since
	extraction of all known resources was completed during 2015. The Daneros Project shows a reduction
	relative to its Technical Report reflecting the extraction in 2012 after that
	Technical Report&#146;s effective date.

	The number shown represents the total mineral resources
	for the Nichols Ranch Project, which is comprised of three properties: the
	Nichols Ranch Wellfield, the Hank Property and the Jane Dough Property. A
	portion of the Jane Dough Property is held through the Arkose Mining
	Venture, in which the Company has an 81% interest; therefore, of these
	resources, approximately 1,405, 5,500 and 1,112 pounds of measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, and inferred mineral
	resources, respectively, are for the account of the Company and the
	remainder are for the account of the other joint venture participant. The Nichols Ranch Wellfield and Hank Property are 100% owned by the Company. This number
	differs from the Nichols Ranch Technical Report number due to adjustments
	made by the Company by subtracting recovered material (272,844 pounds) and
	adding additional resources discovered by drilling during well field
	installation (~82,000 pounds).

	Uranium Project, 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment&#148; dated
	February 28, 2015, prepared by Douglas L. Beahm, P.E., P.G. of BRS Engineering
	and Paul Goranson, P.E. of the Company, in accordance with NI 43-101 (the
	&#147;
<B>
	Nichols Ranch Technical Report
</B>
	&#148;). The Nichols Ranch Technical Report
	includes an updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate and the results of a
	Preliminary Economic Assessment (&#147;
<B>
	PEA

	&#148;) for the uranium resources
	identified to date at the Nichols Ranch Project. Each of the authors are
	&#147;qualified persons&#148; within the meaning of NI 43-101, and Mr. Beahm is
	&#147;independent&#148; of the Company within the meaning of NI 43-101. Because the
	independent author of the Nichols Ranch Technical Report assumed overall
	responsibility for all items of the technical report, the report is therefore an
	independent technical report under NI 43-101. The Nichols Ranch Technical Report
	is available on SEDAR at

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Nichols Ranch Project is the Company&#146;s currently
	active ISR uranium recovery
	project, which it acquired in June 2015 through the acquisition of Uranerz. It
	is located in the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming. The Nichols Ranch
	Project includes: (i) the Nichols Ranch Plant; (ii) the Nichols Ranch Wellfield;
	(iii) the Jane Dough Property; and (iv) the Hank Project, which includes the
	planned Hank Satellite Plant and the Hank Property. The Nichols Ranch Project is
	an ISR project; it is not an underground or open pit project.

	The Nichols Ranch Project is an operating ISR facility that
	recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using
	groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved
	within a deposit. The groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery
	wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a
	yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill where it
	is dried and packaged into drums that are later shipped to a conversion
	facility.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The original plan for the Nichols Ranch Project included the
	construction of an ISR processing facility and a second uranium recovery and
	extraction facility at the Hank Project. Our current extraction plan for the
	Nichols Ranch Project is now divided into three separate areas, being (i) the
	Nichols Ranch Wellfield, (ii) the Jane Dough Property, and (iii) the Hank
	Property. The Nichols Ranch Wellfield is, and the Jane Dough Property is
	expected to be,
	directly connected to the Nichols Ranch Plant via pipeline. The Hank Project
	is expected to consist of a uranium extraction and recovery facility that creates a loaded
	resin that will be trucked to the Nichols Ranch Plant for elution. The Nichols
	Ranch Wellfield consists of our two initial production areas, being Production
	Area #1 and Production Area #2. The Nichols Ranch Wellfield also includes the
	two deep disposal wells that are permitted and constructed for the Nichols Ranch
	Project. The Jane Dough Property is adjacent to the Nichols Ranch Wellfield to
	the south and contains certain properties that are 100% owned by Energy Fuels
	and other properties that are held in the Arkose Mining Venture, in which we own
	an 81% interest. The Jane Dough Property contains two extraction areas that are
	currently in the license and permit to mine amendment process, as described
	below. The Hank Project is 100% owned by Energy Fuels and is located
	approximately six miles east of the Nichols Ranch Wellfield. The Hank Satellite
	Plant is fully licensed and permitted to be constructed and operate as a satellite to the Nichols
	Ranch Plant, and the Hank Property contains two targeted extraction areas.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant was substantially
	completed in 2013, and extraction commenced in the second quarter of 2014 after
	final NRC inspections were completed. The Jane Dough Property described above
	will advance in permitting while we conduct uranium extraction operations at our
	Nichols Ranch Wellfield. In September of 2015, the Company commenced
	construction of an elution and precipitation circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant (which was completed in early-February 2016).
	Yellowcake slurry is now transported from the Nichols Ranch Plant to the White
	Mesa Mill for drying and packaging. However, the Nichols Ranch Plant is
	currently licensed to allow for the construction and operation of a drying and
	packaging circuit should conditions warrant.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Nichols Ranch Project site is located approximately 50 road
	miles southwest of Gillette, Wyoming and 76 road miles northeast of Casper,
	Wyoming in portions of Campbell and Johnson Counties, Wyoming in the Townships
	41 to 45 North and Ranges 73 to 77 West. It is accessed from State Highway 50
	from the east or State Highway 387 from the south, and various internal gravel-surface county and private roads. Casper is on Interstate 25, approximately one
	hour by air from either Denver, Colorado or Salt Lake City, Utah. The Nichols
	Ranch Project is accessible via two-wheel drive vehicles on existing county
	and/or private gravel and dirt roads.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Nichols Ranch Project is located within the Wyoming Basin
	physiographic province in the central portion of the Powder River Basin, within
	the Pumpkin Buttes Mining District. The Pumpkin Buttes are a series of small
	buttes rising several hundred feet above the surrounding plains. Portions of the
	Powder River Basin properties are located east, west and south of these buttes.
	The cap rocks on top of the buttes are erosional remnants of the Tertiary White
	River Formation that is believed to have overlain the majority of the Powder
	River Basin. The volcanic tuffs in the White River Formation have been cited as
	a source of uranium in this basin.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The area in which the Powder River Basin properties is located
	is a low lying plain, and elevations range from approximately 4,390 feet (1,440
	meters) in the northwest to approximately 5,450 feet (1,790 meters) in the
	southeast. Historically and currently the land is used for livestock and
	wildlife grazing. Vegetation is characteristically sagebrush grassland with some
	pines on elevated terrain and some deciduous trees within drainages.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The climate is semi-arid and receives an annual precipitation
	of approximately 9.4 inches, the most falling in the form of late autumnal to
	early spring snows. The summer months are usually hot, dry and clear except for
	infrequent heavy rains. Cold, wind and snow/blizzards can make winter
	exploration work in this area difficult but not impossible. The weather may
	limit the time periods for capital construction but should not have any
	significant adverse impacts on the operation of an ISR facility.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Infrastructure at the site of the Nichols Ranch Project is
	dominantly related to local oil, gas, and coal bed methane exploration and
	development. Mineralized locations could affect future siting of wellfields and
	processing facilities. Generally, the proximity of the Nichols Ranch Project to
	paved roads is beneficial with respect to transportation of equipment, supplies,
	personnel and product to and from the property. Power transmission lines are
	located on or near parts of the property. We have secured power from the local
	electrical service provider to accommodate our needs. Water is available from
	wells developed at planned facility locations, and water for ISR operations
	comes from the operation itself, i.e. the extracted groundwater. Therefore, the
	basic infrastructure (power, water and transportation) required to support an
	ISR mining operation is located within reasonable proximity of the Nichols Ranch
	Project.

	Ownership
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our property interests vary widely, and include unpatented
	mining claims, private and state leasehold interests and surface use rights.
	Some agreements renew annually, some renew automatically when mineral extraction
	has commenced, and some are agreements for fixed terms. For the property
	agreements that expire in 2016, we have negotiated to extend the terms of most
	agreements. Other than a possible increase in carrying cost, we do not expect
	that the expiry of certain property interests in 2016 and beyond will have a
	material effect on our ability to continue exploration and extraction activities
	on our properties.

	Our unpatented lode mining claims are located on minerals owned
	by the federal government and open to location, with the surface being owned
	either by the federal government or private individuals. In addition, the
	unpatented lode mining claims are recorded in the appropriate county and filed
	with the state office of the BLM. The unpatented lode claims do not have an
	expiration date. However, affidavits must be filed annually with the BLM and
	respective county recorder&#146;s offices in order to maintain the claims&#146; validity.
	All of the unpatented lode mining claims have annual filing requirements ($155 per
	claim) with the BLM, to be paid on or before September 1 of each year. Most of
	the above-mentioned unpatented lode mining claims are located on Stock Raising
	Homestead land where the United States government has issued a patent for the
	surface to an individual and reserved the minerals to the United States
	government subject to the location rights by claimants as set forth in the
	federal Mining Act of 1872.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our leasehold interests are subject to the various terms as set
	forth in the applicable leases. The state leases and leases on fee mineral lands
	usually have annual payments, royalty obligations, and the terms of the leases
	vary, but for the most part can be extended by production (as defined in the
	leases). The fee surface and mineral leases apply only to uranium and other
	fissionable minerals and typically have a 10-year term with the right to extend
	the leases with production (as defined in the leases). Commingling of extraction
	from adjacent lands is allowable under the fee mineral leases.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Surface rights under applicable laws allow for exploration
	disturbance, road construction and facility siting. The claimant must first
	notify the surface owner of its intention to locate unpatented lode mining
	claims on the owner&#146;s surface and then reach an agreement with the surface owner
	to pay for damages caused by the claimant&#146;s operations. If an agreement cannot
	be reached, the claimant may post a bond with the BLM to cover the amount of the
	damages caused by the claimant&#146;s operations. We have negotiated surface use
	agreements with various surface owners that provide us with all required surface
	access for the Nichols Ranch Project. The surface use agreements typically
	provide for reimbursement to the surface owner of actual damages resulting from
	our operations.

	overriding royalty interest in favor of Excalibur Industries on all federal
	unpatented lode mining claims that were acquired from Excalibur Industries,
	defined as a gross royalty of six percent when the spot price of uranium is less
	than $45.00 per pound and of eight percent if the uranium spot price is $45.00
	per pound or higher. In addition, there is a portion of the Nichols Ranch
	Wellfield that includes private (fee) mineral that is subject to the above
	Excalibur Industries royalty, plus an additional royalty payable to the fee
	mineral owner under the fee leases (equaling a 12 percent or 16 percent royalty
	depending upon the spot price of uranium). The primary term of the leases expire

	two fee surface and mineral leases, which are not significant, and one surface
	use agreement encompassing approximately 1,393 acres. The Hank Project permit
	boundary encompasses approximately 2,250 acres. Of the 66 unpatented lode mining
	claims comprising the Hank Project, 56 of the claims have a royalty interest
	burden, payable to Excalibur Industries, of 6 or 8 percent depending on the
	price of uranium. This royalty interest is based on uranium produced from these
	claims. The primary term of the leases expire in 2016; however, they can be held
	beyond the primary term by production (as defined in the leases). The Company
	has renewed all but two of these leases through 2026.

	Under the licensed plan, the Nichols Ranch Plant has been
	built, and a satellite processing facility is licensed for the Hank Project. In
	March 2010, Uranerz commenced preparation of the environmental permit and
	license applications for the Jane Dough Property, which is adjacent to the
	Nichols Ranch Wellfield and which is expected to share its infrastructure. This
	enables us to revise the original PO by bringing the Jane Dough Property into
	extraction operations before the Hank Project. Due to its close proximity,
	extracted solutions from the Jane Dough Property may be delivered directly to
	our Nichols Ranch Plant by pipeline, thus eliminating the need for a larger
	capital outlay to construct a satellite plant as is planned for the Hank
	Project. Our Jane Dough Property includes the Doughstick, South Doughstick and
	North Jane properties. Additional wellfields may be added to the extraction
	operations plan as we continue to assess geological data. We submitted the
	following applications in 2014 in order to add the Jane Dough Property to the
	licensed Nichols Ranch Project: (i) a source material license amendment
	application for our Jane Dough Property to the NRC to add the Jane Dough
	Property to the existing license for the Nichols Ranch Project, and (ii) an
	application to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality for an amendment
	to our Permit to Mine to incorporate the Jane Dough Property. These applications
	were accepted for review by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality in
	2014 and the NRC in 2015 and are currently being processed.

	Geology
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Nichols Ranch Project is located in the Powder River Basin.
	The mineralized trends within the Nichols Ranch Project are alteration-reduction
	trends hosted in the Eocene age channel sands that lie at depths of
	approximately 300 to 1,100 feet from the surface. Roll front deposits of uranium
	bearing material are anticipated to occur within these properties. An
	alteration-reduction trend is a natural chemical boundary trend line in a
	sandstone aquifer where reduced (non-oxidized) sand is in contact with altered
	(oxidized) sand. Uranium mineralization may be found along the trend line.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The properties in the Nichols Ranch Project contain
	alteration-reduction trends hosted in Eocene age channel sands.
	Alteration-reduction trends in the Pumpkin Buttes Mining District are typically
	composed of multiple, stacked roll front deposits that often contain associated
	uranium mineralization. A stacked role front is a type of uranium occurrence
	found in thick sandstone where a number of mineralization trends are stacked on
	top of each other. Uranium mineralization within and adjacent to the Nichols
	Ranch Project are found in the Eocene Wasatch Formation (
<B>
	&#147;Wasatch&#148;
</B>
	). The
	Wasatch is a fluvial deposit composed of arkosic sandstones that are typically
	25% or more feldspar grains and indicates a source rock where chemical
	weathering was not extreme and the sediments have not been transported far. A
	fluvial deposit is a deposit of uranium mineralization found in sandstones that
	originated from sediments laid down by streams and rivers. The arkosic sandstone
	is a type of sandstone that contains a high percentage of feldspar grains. The
	medium grain size and relatively good sorting of this sediment implies water
	transportation, probably in a meandering river/stream system. The Wasatch
	formation is interlaid with sandstones, claystones, siltstones, carbonaceous
	shale, and thin coal seams that overlie the Paleocene Fort Union Formation,
	another fluvial sedimentary unit.

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Nichols Ranch Project is located within the Pumpkin Buttes
	Mining District which was the first commercial uranium extraction district in
	Wyoming. Uranium was first discovered in the Pumpkin Buttes in 1951.
	Intermittent uranium extraction from about 55 small mines occurred through 1967
	producing 36,737 tons of material containing 208,143 pounds of uranium. This
	early mining activity focused on shallow oxidized deposits exploited by small
	open pit mines. The material was generally transported to the Atomic Energy
	Commission (
<B>
	&#147;AEC&#148;
</B>
	) buying station in Edgemont, South Dakota. Modern
	mining in the district has focused on deeper reduced deposits, including
	facilities operated by Cameco Corporation and Uranium One Inc.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The properties included in the Nichols Ranch Project were
	originally part of a large exploration area encompassing Townships 33 through 50
	North of Ranges 69 through 79 West, on the 6th principal meridian. In 1966,
	Mountain West Mines Inc. (
<B>
	&#147;MWM&#148;
</B>
	, now known as Excalibur Industries) began
	a successful drilling exploration program in a portion of this area. In 1967,
	MWM entered into an agreement with Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company (
<B>
	&#147;CCI&#148;
</B>
	)
	for further exploration and an option if suitable resources were found. CCI
	exercised its option in 1976 with plans to begin underground mining operations
	in the vicinity of North Butte. Changing economic conditions and the
	introduction of ISR mining technology reportedly ended much of CCI&#146;s interest in
	the area. By the late 1980&#146;s, CCI began selling select properties or allowing
	them to revert back to the federal government.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Between 1968 and 1980 CCI drilled 117 holes and installed 3
	water wells on the Nichols Ranch Project area. Texas Eastern Nuclear Inc. in
	1985 completed limited drilling and exploration on the property (approximately
	28 borings) and in early 1990s Kerr McGee Corporation and Rio Algom Mining
	Corporation also completed limited drilling in the area.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<I>
	Mineralization
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The targeted mineralized zones for the Nichols Ranch Wellfield
	in the A Sand unit are 300 to 700 feet below the surface and occur in two long
	narrow trends meeting at the nose. The nose is in the northwest corner of the
	deposit where the two narrow trends meet to form the tip of the geochemical
	front. The Hank Project&#146;s two targeted mineralized zones in the F Sand unit
	range from 200 to 600 feet below the ground surface depending on the topography
	and changes in the formation elevation and stratigraphic horizon. The targeted
	mineralization zone for the Jane Dough Property is the A Sand unit, the same as
	Nichols Ranch, at depths of 300 to 750 feet below the surface.

	Prior to its acquisition by Energy Fuels in June 2015, Uranerz
	drilled 257 exploration holes, including three core holes and three water wells
	at the Nichols Ranch Project during 2006 and 2007 and 25 exploration holes and
	seven wells in 2009. In addition, Uranerz drilled 61 exploratory holes and seven
	wells within the Hank Property during 2006 and 2007 and eight additional wells
	in 2009. There has been no new drilling activity at the Hank Project since 2009.
	Uranerz drilled 691 exploration holes and 29 wells for baseline monitoring at
	the Jane Dough Property. There has been no new drilling at the Jane Dough
	Property since 2010.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Uranerz drilled a total of 78 rotary drill holes on the Hank
	Property,
	Nichols Ranch Wellfield, and Jane Dough Property during 2006, with 46 holes
	demonstrating uranium mineralization. During 2006, environmental permitting
	activities also continued at the Hank Property and Nichols Ranch Wellfields with the
	completion of a total of five hydrogeologic test wells, and the drilling of six
	core holes. The core was submitted for laboratory testing to support radiation
	permitting requirements as well as to define resource disequilibrium
	attributes.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	From February 19 to December 20, 2007, Uranerz drilled a total
	of 486 uranium trend delineation holes and eight hydrologic sampling wells on
	the Nichols Ranch Project, utilizing as many as three drill rigs and one
	electric log probing unit. This represents a total of approximately 300,000 feet
	of drilling with an average depth of 617 feet per hole. A total of 214
	delineation holes were drilled on Nichols Ranch in 2007. In the final months of
	the 2007 drilling program, exploration efforts focused on the Hank Property and Nichols
	Ranch Wellfield to facilitate sub-surface geologic mapping with cross sections
	and to refine previous geologic models delineating known trends of uranium

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Nichols Ranch Plant is currently engaged in uranium
	recovery operations and is processing uranium-bearing wellfield solutions from
	Production Area #1 of the Nichols Ranch Wellfield. At the current time,
	yellowcake production is occurring at the White Mesa Mill, whereby yellowcake
	slurry is shipped by truck from the Nichols Ranch Project to the Mill where it
	is dried and packaged in drums as uranium concentrate product. Prior to the

	The primary data used in evaluation are equivalent uranium values as quantified
	by downhole geophysical logging reported as %eU
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	.
	Radiometric equilibrium was evaluated and a disequilibrium factor (DEF) of 1 was

	eU
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	. A minimum grade of 0.02% U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	and GT (grade x thickness) of 0.20 were used in these resource
	calculations. Mineral resources are reported at a cutoff of 0.20 GT which is the
	cutoff applied at the Nichols Ranch Project. This 0.2 GT cutoff was used in this
	evaluation without direct relation to an associated price. The table below
	provides a summary of Mineral Resources by classification following CIM
	guidelines. There are no Mineral Reserves on the property at this time. BRS
	noted that it is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title,

	General
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill is a fully licensed uranium and vanadium
	processing facility located in southeastern Utah, approximately six miles south
	of the city of Blanding, Utah. It is within trucking distance of our
	conventional properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, including the
	Canyon Project, the Roca Honda Project, the Henry Mountains Complex, the La Sal
	Project and the Daneros Project. The Mill is the only fully operational and
	licensed conventional uranium mill in the U.S. It is capable of functioning
	independently of off-site support except for commercial power from Rocky Mountain
	Power and as-needed supplemental water supply from the City of Blanding, Utah,
	and the San Juan Water Conservancy District. The White Mesa Mill is a uranium
	processing and recovery facility. It is not an underground or open pit
	project.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Mill is licensed to process an average of 2,000 tons of ore
	per day and to extract over 8.0 million pounds of&nbsp;
	U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	per year. In addition to the conventional circuit,
	the Mill has a separate vanadium co-product recovery circuit.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In addition to the Mill processing equipment, which includes
	the grinding and leaching circuits, CCD (liquid&#150;solid separation), solvent
	extraction, and precipitation and drying circuits, the Mill has several days of
	reagent storage for sulfuric acid, ammonia, salt, soda ash, caustic soda,
	ammonium sulfate, flocculants, kerosene, amines, and liquefied natural gas.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The on-site infrastructure also includes a stockpile area
	capable of storing up to 450,000 tons of mineralized material, and existing
	tailings capacity of approximately 3.5 million tons of solids. In addition, the
	Mill has approximately 90 acres of evaporation capacity.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Synthetic lined cells are used to contain tailings and
	solutions for evaporation. We operate two tailings cells and one or more
	evaporation ponds during normal
	operations. As each tailings cell is filled, the water is drawn off and pumped
	to an evaporation pond and the tailings solids are allowed to dry. As each tailings cell
	reaches final capacity, reclamation begins with the placement of interim cover
	over the tailings. Additional cells are excavated, and the overburden is used to
	reclaim previous cells. In this way, there is an ongoing reclamation process.

	In full operation, the Mill employs approximately 150 people.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<I>
	Alternate Feed Materials
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Mill License (defined below) also gives the Company the
	right to process other uranium-bearing materials known as &#147;alternate feed
	materials&#148; pursuant to an Alternate Feed Guidance published by the NRC. Alternate
	feed materials are uranium-bearing materials, usually classified as waste
	products by the generators of the materials, which can be recycled by the Mill
	for the recovery of U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	. The Mill License does
	not permit the processing of uranium-bearing materials that have undergone
	enrichment. Requiring a routine amendment to the Mill License for each different
	alternate feed material, the Company can process these uranium-bearing materials
	and recover uranium, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost of processing
	conventionally mined material. In other cases, the generators of the alternate
	feed materials are willing to pay a recycling fee to the Company to process
	these materials to recover uranium and then dispose of the remaining by-product
	in the Mill&#146;s licensed tailings cells, rather than directly disposing of the
	materials at a disposal site. By working with the Company and taking the
	recycling approach, the suppliers of alternate feed materials can significantly
	reduce their remediation costs, as there are only a limited number of disposal
	sites for such materials in the United States. Alternate feed materials are
	particularly attractive to Energy Fuels because they carry no associated mining
	costs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Throughout its history, the Mill has received 16 license
	amendments, authorizing it to process 19 different alternate feed materials. Of
	these amendments, ten have involved the processing of feeds provided by nuclear
	fuel cycle facilities and private industry, and one has involved the processing
	of material from the United States Department of Energy (
<B>
	&#147;DOE&#148;
</B>
	). These
	eleven feed materials have been relatively high in uranium content and
	relatively low in volume. The remaining five amendments have allowed the Mill to
	process uranium-bearing soils from former defense sites, known as FUSRAP sites,
	which were being remediated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These materials
	are typically relatively low in uranium content but relatively high in volume.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Mill has a separate circuit for processing certain types of
	alternate feed materials, which was built in 2009. This circuit enables the Mill
	to process both conventionally mined material and alternate feed materials
	simultaneously.

	The Mill is located in central San Juan County, Utah,
	approximately six miles (9.5 km) south of the city of Blanding. It can be
	reached by taking a private road for approximately 0.5 miles west of U.S.
	Highway 191.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The climate of southeastern Utah is classified as dry to arid
	continental. Although varying somewhat with elevation and terrain, the climate
	in the vicinity of the Mill can be considered as semi-arid with normal annual
	precipitation of about 13.4 inches. The weather in the Blanding area is typified
	by warm summers and cold winters. The mean annual temperature in Blanding is
	about 50&#176; (F). Winds are usually light to moderate in the area during all
	seasons, although occasional stronger winds may occur in the late winter and
	spring.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Mill site is located on a gently sloping mesa that, from
	the air, appears similar to a peninsula, as it is surrounded by steep canyons
	and washes and is connected to the Abajo Mountains to the north by a narrow neck
	of land. On the mesa, the topography is relatively flat, sloping at less than
	one (1) percent to the south and nearly horizontal from east to west.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The natural vegetation presently occurring within a 25-mile
	(40-km) radius of the Mill site is very similar to that of the region,
	characterized by pinyon-juniper woodland intergrading with big sagebrush
	(Artemisia tridentata) communities.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Off-site infrastructure includes paved highway access from U.S.
	Highway 191, and rights-of-way for commercial power and a water supply pipeline
	from Recapture Reservoir, which brings up to 1,000 acre-feet of water per year
	to the Mill site. The Mill also has four deep (2,000+ foot) water supply wells
	which are available to supply process water during normal operations.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill is located on 4,816 acres of private land
	owned in fee by Energy Fuels. This land is located in Township 37S and 38S Range
	22E Salt Lake Principal Meridian. Energy Fuels also holds 253 acres of mill site
	claims and a 320 acre Utah state lease. No facilities are planned on the mill
	site claims or leased land, which are used as a buffer to the operations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	All operations authorized by the Mill&#146;s License are conducted
	within the confines of the existing site boundary. The milling facility
	currently occupies approximately 50 acres and the current tailings disposal
	cells encompass another 250 acres.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<I>
	Permitting and Licensing
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill holds a Radioactive Material License
	through the State of Utah (the
<B>
	&#147;Mill License&#148;
</B>
	). Uranium milling in the
	U.S. is primarily regulated by the NRC pursuant to the
<I>
	Atomic Energy Act of
	1954
</I>
	, as amended. The NRC&#146;s primary function is to ensure the protection of
	employees, the public and the environment from radioactive materials, and it
	also regulates most aspects of the uranium recovery process. The NRC regulations
	pertaining to uranium recovery facilities are codified in Title 10 of the Code
	of Federal Regulations. These regulations also apply to our ISR facilities in
	Wyoming.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On August 16, 2004, the State of Utah became an Agreement State
	for the regulation of uranium mills. This means that the primary regulator for
	the White Mesa Mill is UDEQ rather than the NRC. At that time, the Source
	Material License, which was previously issued and regulated by the NRC, was
	transferred to the State and became a Radioactive Materials License. The State
	of Utah incorporates, through its own regulations or by reference, all aspects
	of Title 10 pertaining to uranium recovery facilities. The Mill License was due
	for renewal on March 31, 2007. Energy Fuels&#146; predecessor timely submitted its
	application for renewal of the license on February 28, 2007. A draft renewal
	license was published for comment by UDEQ in the 4
<SUP>
	th
</SUP>
	quarter of 2011. UDEQ is currently in the process of
	reviewing the public comments and performing additional environmental reviews.
	It is expected that UDEQ will re-publish the license for further public comment
	in 2016. Energy Fuels expects that the renewed license will be issued by UDEQ by the end
	of 2016. During the period that the State is reviewing the license renewal
	application, the Mill is authorized to operate under its existing Radioactive
	Materials License. The Mill&#146;s license was initially issued in 1980 and was
	renewed in 1987 and 1997.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	When the State of Utah became an Agreement State, it required
	that a Groundwater Discharge Permit (
<B>
	&#147;GWDP&#148;
</B>
	) be put in place for the
	White Mesa Mill. The GWDP is required for all similar facilities in the State of
	Utah, and implements the State groundwater regulations to the Mill site. The
	State of Utah requires that every operating uranium mill have a GWDP, regardless
	of whether or not the facility discharges to groundwater. The GWDP for the Mill
	was finalized and implemented in March 2005. The GWDP required that the Mill add
	over 40 additional monitoring parameters and 15 additional monitoring wells at
	the site. The GWDP came up for renewal in 2010, at which time an application for
	renewal was timely submitted. The renewal application is currently under review
	by UDEQ. During the review period the Mill can continue to
	operate under its existing GWDP. The White Mesa Mill also maintains a permit for
	air emissions with the UDEQ, Division of Air Quality.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill is subject to decommissioning liabilities.
	Energy Fuels, as part of the Mill License, is required to annually review its
	estimate for the decommissioning of the White Mesa Mill site and submit it to
	UDEQ for approval. The estimate of closure costs for the Mill is $22.1 million
	as of December 31, 2015, and financial assurances are in place for the
	total amount. However, there can be no assurance that the ultimate cost of such
	reclamation obligations will not exceed the estimated liability contained in the
	Company&#146;s financial statements.

<I>
	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Mill was originally constructed and owned by Energy Fuels
	Nuclear, Inc. (
<B>
	&#147;EFN&#148;
</B>
	) and its affiliates (no relation to the Company). It
	was licensed by the NRC and commenced operations in June 1980. In 1984, EFN
	transferred a 70% interest in the Mill to UMETCO Minerals Corp., a subsidiary of
	Union Carbide Corporation (
<B>
	&#147;UMETCO&#148;
</B>
	). UMETCO became the operator of the
	Mill in 1984 and continued to be the operator until 1994, at which time it
	transferred its interest in the Mill back to EFN and its affiliates. The Mill
	was acquired by Denison Mines Corp. (
<B>
	&#147;Denison&#148;
</B>
	), then named International
	Uranium Corporation (
<B>
	&#147;IUC&#148;
</B>
	) and its affiliates in 1997, and was operated
	by Denison until it was acquired by the Company in June 2012. From the original
	commissioning in 1980 through December 31, 2015, the Mill has recovered a total
	of approximately 36 million pounds of U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	and 46
	millionpounds of vanadium.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In late 2006, Denison began a program to refurbish the Mill.
	The refurbishment program included the purchase of mobile equipment, restoration
	of the vanadium roasting, fusion and packaging circuits, replacement of major
	pumps and component drives, modernization of the Mill&#146;s instrumentation and
	process control systems, and completion of relining tailings Cell 4A. The total
	cost of the refurbishment program was approximately $31.0 million and was
	completed in 2008.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign
	basis. In 2008, the Mill began processing uranium/vanadium conventional
	material, extracting uranium concentrate in the form of
	U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>

</SUB>
	, and vanadium in the form of
	V
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	5
</SUB>
	. Mineral processing continued through the end of
	March 2009, at which time maintenance activities were performed at the Mill. Mineral
	processing recommenced near the end of April 2009, but was discontinued due to a
	decline in uranium prices at the time. The Mill began mineral processing again
	in March 2010 and continued through June 2011. Conventional processing
	recommenced in November 2011 and continued until early March 2012, at which time
	it ceased for routine maintenance. Conventional mineral processing recommenced
	at the Mill in August 2012 and continued until early June 2013. Mineral
	processing began again in May 2014 and continued through August 2014. The
	alternate feed circuit processed materials from January through December 2014,
	and continued processing alternate feed materials through December 2015.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Energy Fuels acquired the Mill from Denison Mines Corp. on June
	29, 2012. All mineral processing after that date has been for the account of
	Energy Fuels. Mineral processing at the Mill over the past five years is shown
	below. (Note, only mineral processing since June 30, 2012 has been for the
	account of Energy Fuels).

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Prior to Energy Fuels&#146; acquisition of the Mill from Denison,
	chloroform in the shallow aquifer at the White Mesa Mill site was discovered.
	The chloroform appears to have resulted from the operation of a temporary
	laboratory facility that was located at the site prior to and during the
	construction of the Mill, and from septic drain fields that were used for
	laboratory and sanitary wastes prior to construction of the Mill&#146;s tailings
	cells. In April 2003, Denison commenced an interim remedial program of pumping
	the chloroform affected water from the groundwater to the Mill&#146;s tailings
	system. This action enabled Energy Fuels to begin cleanup of the affected areas
	and to take a further step towards resolution of this outstanding issue. Pumping
	from the wells continued in 2015. On September 14, 2015, the State of Utah
	approved a long-term Corrective Action Plan (
<B>
	&#147;CAP&#148;
</B>
	) for cleanup of the
	chloroform, which involves continued pumping of the affected water to the Mill&#146;s
	tailings system. While the investigations to date indicate that this chloroform
	appears to be contained in a manageable area, the scope and costs of final
	remediation have not yet been determined and could be significant.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Prior to Energy Fuels&#146; acquisition of the Mill from Denison,
	elevated concentrations of nitrate and chloride were observed in some of the
	monitoring wells at the White Mesa Mill site in 2008, a number of which are
	upgradient of the Mill&#146;s tailings cells. Pursuant to a Stipulated Consent
	Agreement with UDEQ, Denison retained INTERA, Inc., an independent professional
	engineering firm, to investigate these elevated concentrations and to prepare a
	Contamination Investigation Report for submittal to UDEQ. The investigation was
	completed in 2009, and the Contamination Investigation Report was submitted to
	UDEQ in January 2010. INTERA concluded in the Report that: (1) the nitrate and
	chloride are co-extensive and appear to originally come from the same source;
	and (2) the source is upgradient of the Mill property and is not the result of
	Mill activities. UDEQ reviewed the Report, and concluded that further
	investigations were required before it could determine the source of the
	contamination and the responsibility for cleanup. Such investigations were
	performed in 2010 and 2011, but were considered to be inconclusive by UDEQ. As a
	result, after the investigations, it was determined that there are site
	conditions that make it difficult to ascertain the source(s) of contamination at
	the site, and that it was not possible at that time to determine the source(s),
	causes(s), attribution, magnitude(s) of contribution, and proportion(s) of the
	local nitrate and chloride in groundwater. For those reasons, UDEQ decided that
	it could not eliminate Mill activities as a potential cause, either in full or
	in part, of the contamination. The Company and UDEQ have therefore agreed that
	resources are better spent in developing a CAP, rather than continuing with
	further investigations as to the source(s) and attribution of the groundwater
	contamination. Pursuant to a revised Stipulated Consent Agreement, Denison
	submitted a draft CAP for remediation of the contamination to UDEQ in November
	2011. The CAP proposed a program of pumping the nitrate contaminated groundwater
	to the Mill&#146;s tailings cells, similar to the chloroform remedial program. UDEQ
	approved the CAP on December 12, 2012. In accordance with the CAP, in 2013 the
	Company commenced pumping nitrate/chloride contaminated water from four
	monitoring wells for use in Mill processing or discharge into the Mill&#146;s process
	or tailings cells. Although the contamination appears to be contained in a
	manageable area, the scope and costs of final remediation have not yet been
	determined and could be significant.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During 2011, 2012, and 2013, the White Mesa Mill reported
	consecutive exceedances of groundwater compliance limits (&#147;
<B>
	GWCLs
</B>
	&#148;) under
	the Mill&#146;s GWDP for several constituents in several wells, and there are
	decreasing trends in pH in a number of wells across the site that have caused
	the pH in a number of compliance monitoring wells to have dropped below their
	GWCLs. These exceedances and pH trends include wells that are up-gradient of the
	Mill facilities, far down-gradient of the Mill site and at the site itself.
	These consecutive exceedances of GWCLs have resulted in violations of the GWDP.
	Source Assessment Reports were submitted in 2012 and 2013 addressing each
	exceedance and the decreasing trends in pH at the site. UDEQ has accepted the
	Source Assessment Reports, and has concluded that such exceedances and decreasing
	trends in pH are due to natural background influences at the site. UDEQ has
	agreed to revise the GWCLs in the GWDP to account for these background
	influences, which would put those constituents, including pH at the site, back
	into compliance.

	Property Description and Location
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Canyon Project is a partially constructed underground
	uranium project with: a headframe, a hoist, a compressor and a partially sunk
	shaft. The site is located south of the Grand Canyon National Park, in Sections
	19 and 20, T29N, R3E, Coconino County, Arizona, 153 miles north of Phoenix and
	six miles south of Tusayan, Arizona in the Kaibab National Forest. The Canyon
	Project was acquired by Energy Fuels in its June 2012 acquisition of Denison&#146;s
	US Mining Division.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Canyon Project is located in the Arizona Strip mining
	district. The Arizona Strip is an area largely bounded on the north by the
	Arizona/Utah state line; on the east by the Colorado River and Marble Canyon; on
	the west by the Grand Wash Cliffs; and on the south by a midpoint between the
	city of Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. The area encompasses approximately
	13,000 square miles. Uranium-bearing material from the Arizona Strip mines is
	hauled by truck to the White Mesa Mill where it is processed. The Company&#146;s
	Arizona 1, Pinenut and EZ Projects are located north of the Grand Canyon. The
	Canyon Project, along with the Wate Project, are located south of the Grand
	Canyon. The Canyon Project is 325 road miles from the Mill.

	on the Canyon property due to a prior owner of the claims.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Holding costs for the Canyon Project are minimal and consist
	entirely of annual fees for unpatented mining claims ($155 per claim per year)
	and county filing fees (approximately $10 per claim per year). Unpatented mining
	claims expire annually, but are subject to indefinite annual renewal by filing
	appropriate documents and paying the fees described above. In addition, holders
	of unpatented mining claims on USFS lands are generally granted surface access
	by the USFS to conduct mineral exploration and mining activities.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Canyon Project is located on public lands managed by the
	USFS and has an approved PO with the USFS. In September 2009, the groundwater
	General Permit was received for the storm water storage ponds. An Air Quality
	Permit was issued by ADEQ in March 2011, which is up for renewal in 2016.
	Although the Canyon Project is estimated to contain 82,800 tons of mineralized

	National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (&#147;
<B>
	NESHAP&#146;s
</B>
	&#148;) approval
	under the U.S. Clean Air Act, the Company received EPA&#146;s approval of a voluntary NESHAP&#146;s
	application for the Canyon Project in September of 2015, in order to be prepared
	in the event the total tons of mineralized material over the life of the project
	were to exceed 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Development of uranium-bearing breccia pipes of the
	Arizona Strip requires minimal surface disturbance, typically less than 20
	acres, and has little if any impact on groundwater since most of the mines are
	relatively dry. The overall environmental impact is small. Nevertheless, the
	Grand Canyon area is environmentally sensitive in many ways and the permitting,
	development, and operation of a uranium extraction facility in this area is a contentious
	issue. In 2009, as described below, over one million acres of federal land were
	withdrawn from mineral location, subject to valid existing rights. Currently,
	there are proposals being considered that would create a National Monument in
	areas near the Grand Canyon National Park, including the land for the Canyon
	Project, subject to valid existing rights. Environmental liabilities at the Canyon
	Project are bonded at their
	total expected reclamation cost.

	Geological Setting
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Parts of two distinct physiographic provinces are found within
	Arizona: the Basin and Range province in the southern and western edge of the
	state, and the Colorado Plateau province in most of northern and central
	Arizona. The Arizona Strip lies within the Colorado Plateau province.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Surface exposures within the Arizona Strip reveal sedimentary
	and volcanic rocks ranging in age from upper Paleozoic to Quaternary; the area
	is largely underlain by Mississippian through Triassic sedimentary rocks.
	However, exposed within the Grand Canyon are older rocks reaching Precambrian in
	age.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of northern Arizona are host to
	thousands of breccia pipes. These deposits are known to extend from the
	Mississippian Redwall Limestone to the Triassic Chinle Formation, which makes
	about 4,000 feet of section. However, because of erosion and other factors, no
	single deposit has been observed cutting through the entire section. No deposit
	is known to occur above the Chinle Formation or below the Redwall Limestone.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Breccia pipes within the Arizona Strip are vertical or near
	vertical, circular to elliptical bodies of broken rock. Broken rock is comprised
	of slabs and rotated angular blocks and fragments of surrounding and
	stratigraphically higher formations. Surrounding the blocks and slabs making up
	the breccia is a matrix of fine material comprised of surrounding and overlying rock from various formations. The
	matrix has been cemented by silicification and calcification for the most
	part.

<A NAME="eolPage68"></A>
<A NAME="FORM10K_HTM_PAGE_68">
</A>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Breccia pipes are typically comprised of three interrelated
	features: a basinal or structurally shallow depression at surface (designated by
	some as a collapse cone); a breccia pipe which underlies the structural
	depression; and annular fracture rings which occur outside of, but at the margin
	of the pipes. Annular fracture rings are commonly, but not always, mineralized.
	The structural depression may be up to 0.5 miles or more in diameter, whereas
	the breccia pipe diameters range up to about 600 feet; the normal range is 200
	feet to 300 feet.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Mineralized breccia pipes found to date appear to occur in
	clusters or trends. Spacing between breccia pipes ranges from hundreds of feet
	within a cluster to several miles within a trend. Pipe location may have been
	controlled by deep seated faults, but karstification of the Redwall Limestone in
	Mississippian and Permian times is considered to have initiated formation of the
	numerous and widespread breccia pipes in the region.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At the Canyon deposit, the surface expression of the pipe is a
	broad shallow depression in the Permian Kaibab Formation. The pipe is
	essentially vertical with an average diameter of less than 200 feet, but it is
	considerably narrower through the Coconino and Hermit horizons (80 feet). The
	cross sectional area is probably between 20,000 and 25,000 square feet. The pipe
	extends for at least 2,300 feet from the Toroweap limestone to the upper Redwall
	horizons. The ultimate depth of the deposit is unknown.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Mineralization extends over about 1,700 vertical feet, with
	higher grade mineralization found mainly in the Coconino, Hermit, and Esplanade
	horizons and at the margins of the pipe in fracture zones. Sulphide zones are
	found scattered throughout the pipe but are especially concentrated (sulphide
	cap) near the Toroweap Coconino contact, where the cap averages 20 feet thick
	and consists of pyrite and bravoite, an iron-nickel sulphide. The mineralized
	assemblage consists of uranium-pyrite-hematite with massive copper sulphide
	mineralization common in and near the higher grade zone. The strongest
	mineralization appears to occur in the lower Hermit-upper Esplanade horizons in
	an annular fracture zone.

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<I>
	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Uranium exploration and mining of breccia pipe uranium deposits
	started in 1951 when a geologist employed by the U.S. Geological Survey noted
	uranium ore on the dump of an old copper prospect on the South Rim of the Grand
	Canyon of Northern Arizona. The prospect was inside the Grand Canyon National
	Park, but on fee land that predated the park. A mining firm acquired the
	prospect and mined this significant high grade uranium deposit, called the
	Orphan Mine. By the time mining ended in the early 1960s, 4.26 million pounds of
	U
<SUB>

<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	and some minoramounts of copper and silver had been
	produced.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	After the discovery of the first deposit in the 1950s, an
	extensive search for other deposits was made by the government and industry, but
	only a few low grade prospects were found. Exploration started again in the
	early 1970s. In the mid-1970s, Western Nuclear Inc. (
<B>
	&#147;Western Nuclear&#148;
</B>
	)
	acquired the Hack Canyon prospect located about 25 miles north of the Grand
	Canyon and found high grade uranium mineralization offsetting an old shallow
	copper/uranium site. In the next few years, a second deposit was found
	approximately one mile away. EFN acquired the Hack Canyon property from Western
	Nuclear in December 1980. Construction started promptly, and the Hack Canyon
	mine was in production by the end of 1981.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Canyon deposit is located on mining claims that EFN
	acquired from Gulf Mineral Resources Company (
<B>
	&#147;Gulf&#148;
</B>
	) in 1982. Gulf
	drilled eight exploration holes at the site from 1978 through May 1982 but found
	only low-grade uranium in this pipe. Additional drilling completed by EFN in
	1983 identified a major deposit. EFN drilled a further 36 holes from May 1983
	through April 1985 to delineate the uranium mineralization and to determine
	placement of the shaft and water supply well. Additional drilling of six
	holes was completed in 1994. Construction at the site was discontinued as a
	result of low uranium prices at that time.

	EFN identified and investigated more than 4,000 circular
	features in northern Arizona. About 110 of the most prospective features were
	explored by deep drilling, and approximately 50% of those drilled were shown to
	contain some uranium mineralization. Ultimately, nine deposits were deemed
	worthy of development. Total mine production from the EFN breccia pipes from
	1980 through 1991 was approximately 19.1million pounds

	Denison did not carry out any exploration on the Canyon Project
	since its acquisition of the project in 1997, nor has the Company to
	date. Exploration for breccia pipes in northern Arizona typically begins with a
	search for surface expressions of circular features. This search was aided by
	geologic mapping, Landsat aerial photography, thermal infrared imagery,
	geochemical testing, and certain geophysical methods such as resistivity, Very
	Low Frequency (VLF), and time domain electromagnetics. Other techniques tested
	included: geobotany, microbiology, and biogeochemistry. All of these methods
	were utilized to identify surface expressions of breccia pipes. The key element
	of the process was to zero in on the throat of the pipe as a locus for drilling
	from the surface since the throat is usually associated directly with the center
	of the collapse.

	Mineralization
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In the breccia pipe deposits of the Arizona Strip, uranium
	occurs largely as blebs, streaks, small veins, and fine disseminations of
	uraninite/pitchblende. Mineralization is mainly confined to matrix material, but
	may extend into clasts and larger breccia fragments, particularly where these
	fragments are of Coconino sandstone. An extensive suite of anomalous elements
	has also been reported, including: silver, arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt,
	chromium, cesium, copper, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony, selenium,
	strontium, vanadium, and zinc. In addition, many of the rare earth elements are
	consistently enriched in uranium-mineralized samples. Within some breccia pipes,
	copper occurs in sufficient concentrations to be potentially economic. Silver is
	almost always anomalously high and some of the pipes carry potentially economic
	grades. Within many pipes, there is a definite mineralogical zoning in and
	around the uranium mineralization.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	These breccia pipes are surrounded by bleached zones where
	unaltered red sediments contrast sharply with grey-green bleached material. Age
	dating and disequilibrium determinations indicate that remobilization of uranium
	has occurred. Uranium concentrations in the upper levels of a pipe tend to be in
	equilibrium. With depth, disequilibrium in the deposits increases in favour of
	the chemical assays.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Uranium mineralization at the Canyon Project is concentrated in
	three stratigraphic levels: Coconino, Hermit/Esplanade, and a lower zone.
	Mineralization extends vertically from a depth of 600 feet to over 2,100 feet.

	The Roca Honda Project is an underground uranium project that
	is being permitted by the Company&#146;s 60% subsidiary, Roca Honda Resources, LLC
	(&#147;RHR&#148;). The Roca Honda Project was acquired on August 29, 2013, as a result of
	the acquisition of Strathmore Minerals Corp. The Roca Honda Project is located
	approximately three miles northwest of the community of San Mateo, New Mexico,
	near the southern boundary of McKinley County and north of the Cibola County
	boundary, and approximately 22 miles by road northeast of Grants, New Mexico. The property is located in the east part of the
	Ambrosia Lake subdistrict of the Grants Mineral Belt in northwest New Mexico and
	comprises nearly all of Sections 9, 10, and a narrow strip of Section 11, and a
	New Mexico State Lease, consisting of Section 16, all in Township 13 North &#150;
	Range 8 West (T13N-R8W), New Mexico Principal Meridian. Mineralized material
	from the Roca Honda Project will be shipped by highway truck to the White Mesa
	Mill, where it will be processed for the recovery of uranium. The Roca Honda
	Project does not have known reserves, and is therefore considered under SEC
	Industry Guide 7 definitions to be exploratory in nature.

	(
<B>
	&#147;Fernandez&#148;
</B>
	). It is located approximately 17 air miles and 22 road miles
	northeast of Grants, New Mexico. The southern portion of the project, on Section
	16, can be reached by traveling north from Milan on New Mexico State Highway 605
	toward the town of San Mateo and then north on a public gravel road. Access from
	Highway 605 onto Sections 20, 17 and 16 requires a surface use agreement with
	the surface owner, Fernandez. We believe we acquired surface access rights to
	those Sections when we acquired Section 17 in 2015 (See &#147;
<I>
	Acquisition of
	Properties Adjacent to the RHR Joint Venture Properties&#148;,

	currently in discussions with Fernandez to determine what, if any, additional
	surface access rights are required and to negotiate a comprehensive updated
	access and right of way agreement for all Roca Honda property within the
	proposed permit area to replace all existing surface use agreements. Proof of
	right-of-entry will be required before mine construction can commence.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The north part of the project can be reached by traveling 23.5
	miles from Milan, New Mexico, on paved public Highway 605, and then west on US
	Forest Service roads to the southeast corner of Section 10. There are numerous
	drill roads that provide access to different portions of Sections 9 and 10, many
	of which will require maintenance. Old drill roads were previously established
	across the property, and an electrical line transects the northern half of
	Section 16 in the project area. The line continues on the west side of the
	project area into Section 17, where it terminates, and on the east side of
	Section 16 through the northwest quarter of Section 15 and along the southern
	section boundary of Section 10. No milling operations are expected to occur on

	summers. On average, the Roca Honda property receives approximately 11 inches of
	precipitation annually, most of which occurs during thunderstorms in July and
	August. Grants, New Mexico has an annual average temperature of 50&#176;F, with an
	average summer high of 87&#176;F and low of 52&#176;F, and average winter high of 47&#176;F and

	The Roca Honda Project area is sparsely populated, rural and
	largely undeveloped. The predominant land uses include low density grazing and
	cultivation, and recreational activities such as hiking, sightseeing, and
	seasonal hunting. The Roca Honda property has moderately rough topography in
	Sections 9 and 10 and consists of shaly slopes below ledge-forming sandstone
	beds, as mesas, that dip 7&#176; to 11&#176; northeast. Elevations range from 7,100 feet
	to 7,800 feet. Section 9 consists mostly of steep slopes in the west and south,
	with a large sandstone mesa in the north central part. Section 10 consists
	mostly of the dip-slope of a sandstone bed that dips from 8&#176; to 11&#176; east.
	Section 16 has less topographic relief, with elevations ranging from 7,100 to

	currently preparing a Supplemental EIS to address a new discharge pipeline
	alternative and expansion of the Roca Honda Project into Section 17. Other major
	permits required for the Roca Honda Project include a Permit to Mine to be
	issued by the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division, a Discharge Permit issued
	by the New Mexico Environment Department, and a Mine Dewatering Permit issued by
	the New Mexico State Engineer&#146;s Office. The Mine Dewatering Permit was approved
	in December 2013 but appealed by the Acoma Pueblo in January 2014. RHR
	subsequently proposed a new alternative for discharging treated mine water that
	would benefit a number of downstream users including the Acoma Pueblo. As a
	result, the Acoma Pueblo agreed to withdraw the dewatering permit appeal in
	March 2015.

	The uranium found in the Roca Honda Project area is contained
	within five sandstone units of the Westwater Canyon Member. Zones of
	mineralization vary from approximately one foot to 32 ft. thick, 100 ft. to 600
	ft. wide, and 200 ft. to 2,000 ft. long. Uranium mineralization in the Project

	mineralization across the Ambrosia Lake subdistrict.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Kerr-McGee Oil Industries, Inc. (&#147;Kerr-McGee&#148;) staked the Roca
	Honda Project unpatented mining claims in Sections 9 and 10 in June 1965.
	Kerr-McGee, its subsidiaries, and successor in interest Rio Algom had held the
	claims until the property was acquired by Strathmore on March 12, 2004. Energy
	Fuels acquired a 100% interest in Strathmore in September 2013, assuming
	Strathmore&#146;s 60% ownership interest in RHR and becoming the project operator.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Drilling on the property began in 1966. Kerr-McGee performed a
	number of rotary drill hole exploration programs from 1966 to 1985. In Section
	9, the first drill hole was completed in July 1966. Discovery was made in drill
	hole number 7 completed on August 2, 1970, which encountered mineralization at a
	depth of 1,900 ft. From 1966 to 1982, a total of 187 drill holes were completed
	for a total of 388,374 ft.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In Section 10, the first hole was drilled in October 1967.
	Discovery was made in drill hole number 6 completed on March 19, 1974, which
	encountered mineralization at a depth of 2,318 ft. From 1967 to 1985, a total of
	175 drill holes were completed for a total of 459,535 ft.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In Section 16, the first drilling was in the 1950s by Rare
	Metals, which drilled 13 holes, including two that intercepted high-grade
	uranium mineralization at depths of 1,531 ft. and 1,566 ft. No records of the
	total drilled footage were located. Subsequently, Western Nuclear acquired a
	mining lease for Section 16 from the State and began drilling in 1968, with the
	first drill hole completed on August 17, 1968. The second drill hole intercepted
	high- grade uranium mineralization at a depth of 1,587 ft. From 1968 through
	September 1970, Western Nuclear drilled 63 holes totaling 121,164 feet, not
	including six abandoned holes totaling 7,835 ft. Two of the drill holes reported
	cored intervals, but the cores and analyses were not available.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	RHR drilled four pilot holes on Section 16, of which three were
	completed as monitor wells totaling 8,050 feet for environmental baseline and
	monitoring purposes in Section 16 from June through November 2007. One drill
	hole was located outside of known mineralization, and three holes were located
	within mineralized areas. The entire thickness of the Westwater Sandstone,
	except for zones with no recovery, was cored in the pilot holes for these wells.
	The cores are PQ diameter (3.345 in.) and were taken principally for laboratory
	testing of hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, density, and chemical
	analysis.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In November 2011, a core hole was drilled at the Section 16
	shaft location (Figure 10-2). The hole was drilled to a depth of 2,053 ft. Core
	was tested for numerous geotechnical properties.

	Mineralization
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Uranium mineralization consists of unidentifiable
	organic-uranium oxide complexes. The uranium in the project area is dark grey to
	black in color, and is found between depths of approximately 1,650 feet and
	2,600 feet below the surface.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Primary mineralization pre-dates, and is not related to,
	present structural features. There is a possibility of some redistribution and
	stack mineralization along faults; however, it appears that most of the Roca
	Honda Project mineralization is primary.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Paleochannels that contain quartz-rich, arkosic, fluvial
	sandstones are the primary mineralization control associated with this trend.
	Previous mining operations within the immediate area suggest that faults in the
	Roca Honda Project area associated with the San Mateo fault zone post-date the
	emplacement of uranium. Therefore, it may be expected that mineralized zones in
	the Roca Honda Project area are offset by faults.

	The mineralization is typically confined to sandstones in the
	Westwater Canyon Member, although there is some overlap into the shales that
	divide the sandstones, and also some minor extension (less than 10 feet) into
	the underlying Recapture Member. The mineralization is contained in the
	Westwater Canyon Member sandstones across the Project area, but in Sections 9
	and 16, the mineralization is typically found in the upper sandstones (A, B1,
	and B2). In Section 10, the A and B1 sandstones pinch out in some areas due to
	thickening of the overlying Brushy Basin Member. Mineralization in the middle

	current estimate of mineral resources or mineral reserves, and as such the
	Company is not treating it as a current estimate of mineral reserves or mineral
	resources. However, the Company believes the estimate is relevant and reliable,
	as it was prepared within the last two years by a reputable mining consultant.
	In order to upgrade and verify this historical estimate and classify it as a
	current mineral resource estimate, the Company needs to perform further
	evaluations of the report and confirm that its underlying assumptions continue
	to be reasonable and that the report is complete and current. The mineralized
	areas with the best potential to hold mineral resources are Section 17, where
	over 500 holes have been drilled, and Section 11 where historical data from
	wide-spaced holes drilled by Conoco, Homestake and Anaconda provides an

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Sheep Mountain Project is an underground and open pit
	uranium project that is currently being permitted by the Company. The Sheep
	Mountain Project was acquired on February 29, 2012, as a result of the Company&#146;s
	acquisition of Titan. The Sheep Mountain Project is located eight miles south of
	Jeffrey City, Wyoming within the Wyoming Basin physiographic province at the
	northern edge of the Great Divide Basin in central Wyoming. The project is
	located in portions of Sections 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30,
	31, 32, and 33, Township 28 North, Range 92 West.

	The Sheep Mountain Project includes the Congo Pit, a proposed
	open pit uranium extraction facility, and the reopening of the existing Sheep
	Underground facility. Although alternatives were considered, the recommended
	recovery method in the Sheep Mountain Technical Report includes the processing
	of extracted materials via an on-site heap leach facility. Material from the
	underground and open pit operations are expected to be commingled at the stockpile site located near the underground portal and in
	close proximity to the pit. At the stockpile, the mineralized material will be
	sized if needed, blended, and then conveyed via a covered overland conveyor
	system to the heap leach pad where it will be stacked on a double lined pad for
	leaching. The primary lixiviant will be sulfuric acid. Concentrated leach
	solution will be collected by gravity in a double lined collection pond and then
	transferred to the mineral processing facility for extraction and drying. The
	final product produced will be uranium concentrate (U

	also known as &#147;yellowcake&#148;). Since the Sheep Mountain Technical Report was
	completed, Energy Fuels has acquired the White Mesa Mill and the Nichols Ranch
	Plant, which creates the option to transport loaded resin to either of those
	facilities for stripping, and to the White Mesa Mill for drying, and packaging
	of yellowcake.

	The preferred alternative for the development of the Sheep
	Mountain Project begins the operation with the open pit and heap leach facility
	and brings the underground component of the project into operation about five
	years later such that the forecasted end of extraction for both the open pit and
	underground components coincide. This approach defers a substantial amount of
	initial capital, minimizes risk, and allows for a gradual startup of site
	activities while maximizing resource recovery. Having the end of extraction
	coincide for both operations also optimizes the fixed costs of personnel and
	facilities. A preliminary feasibility study (
<B>
	&#147;PFS&#148;
</B>
	) for the project has
	been completed in accordance with NI 43-101, which includes the preliminary
	design and sequencing of the open pit and underground operations and the heap
	leach mineral processing facility. Designs and sequencing are inclusive of
	pre-production, production, and decommissioning and reclamation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The current design for the Congo Pit includes typical highwall
	heights in the range of 100 to 400 feet, and reaches a maximum depth of 600 feet
	in localized areas in the southeast pit corner. The open pit design employs
	similar design parameters and mining equipment configurations to those used
	successfully in past Wyoming conventional operations. Highwall design is based
	upon the performance of past projects in the Sheep Mountain and Gas Hills
	districts, and includes an average highwall slope of 0.7:1, which reflects the
	average of a 10-foot bench width and 50-foot wall at a 0.5:1 slope.

	The underground method proposed is also a conventional method
	using a modified room and pillar method, but utilizing modern equipment such as
	jumbo drills and 7 cubic-yard scooptrams for haulage. A new double entry decline
	will be constructed starting at the Paydirt Pit and ending below the deposit.
	Haulage from the facility will be accomplished via a 36-inch conveyor within one of
	the double declines. The existing shafts will be used for ventilation purposes
	only, with exhaust fans mounted at both locations. If the existing borehole
	ventilation shafts can be rehabilitated, they will be used as intake shafts.

	The mineral properties at the Sheep Mountain Project are
	comprised of 192 unpatented mining claims (the Company added 13 claims to the
	179 reported in the Sheep Mountain Technical Report) on land administered by the
	BLM; approximately 640 acres of State of Wyoming leases; and approximately 630
	acres of private leases on fee lands. In February 2012, Energy Fuels purchased
	320 acres of private surface overlaying some of the federal minerals covered by
	18 of the claims. The purchased parcel includes the SW&#188; SW&#188; Section 28 and SE&#188;,

	In June 2010, Titan commenced baseline environmental studies to
	support an application to the NRC for a Source Material and By-product Material
	License (the
<B>
	&#147;License&#148;

	radiological monitoring, and cultural resource surveys.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Submission of the PO to the BLM was made in June 2011. The PO
	was accepted as complete by the BLM, and an EIS was initiated in August 2011.
	Energy Fuels revised the PO in July 2012, consistent with the modified plan
	presented in the Sheep Mountain Technical Report. In July 2013, the PO was again
	revised to reflect a new waste rock disposal layout for the open pit mine and an
	improved and more economical heap leach and processing facility. The revised PO
	also included the option of transporting mineralized material off-site for
	processing. The EIS is in the late stage of permitting, with a Final EIS
	expected to be issued in mid-to-late 2016.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In October 2011, Titan submitted a draft revision to its

	draft application to NRC for a Source Material License was reviewed in detail by
	the NRC in October 2011. The NRC audit report identified areas where additional
	information should be provided. The review and approval process for this license
	by the NRC is anticipated to take approximately four years from the date
	submitted to the NRC. Submittal of the license application to the NRC is on hold

	Geological Setting
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A primary component of the geology for the Sheep Mountain
	Project is the Battle Spring Formation. Battle Spring is Eocene in age. Prior to
	deposition of the Battle Spring Formation and subsequent younger Tertiary
	formations, underlying Paleocene, Cretaceous, and older formations were deformed
	during the Laramide Orogeny. During the Laramide Orogeny, faults, including the
	Emigrant Thrust Fault at the northern end of the project area, were active and
	displaced sediments by over 20,000 feet. Coincident with this mountain building
	event, Paleocene and older formations were folded in a series of echelon
	anticlines and synclines, generally trending from southeast to northwest. The
	Battle Spring Formation was deposited unconformably on an erosional landscape
	influenced by these pre-depositional features. Initial stream channels
	transporting clastic sediments from the Granite Mountains formed in the
	synclinal valleys.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The geologic setting of the Sheep Mountain Project is important
	in that it controlled uranium mineralization by focusing movement of the
	groundwaters which emplaced the uranium into the stream channels which had
	developed on the pre-tertiary landscape. The Battle Spring Formation and
	associated mineralization at the Sheep Mountain Project is bounded to the east by the western flank of the
	Sheep Mountain Syncline and to the west by the Spring Creek Anticline. To the
	north the system is cut off by erosion. To the south the Battle Spring continues
	into the northern portions of the Great Divide Basin.

	Mineralization occurs throughout the lower A Member of the

	Member is present only in portions of the project and may be up to 500 feet
	thick. Although arkosic sandstone is the preferred host, uranium has been
	extracted from all lithologies. Grade and thickness are extremely variable
	depending on whether the samples are taken from the nose or the tails of a roll
	front. Typically the deposits range from 50 feet to 200 feet along a strike,
	five feet to eight feet in height, and 20 feet to 100 feet in width. Deposits in

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Sheep Mountain Project was acquired by Energy Fuels on
	February 29, 2012, as a result of the Company&#146;s acquisition of Titan, which is
	now a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Fuels. Titan acquired the Sheep Mountain
	Project in two transactions in 2009. A 50% working interest was acquired when
	Titan completed a business combination with Uranium Power Corp. (
<B>
	&#147;UPC&#148;
</B>
	)
	on July 31, 2009. UPC is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Fuels. At that
	time, UPC and UPC&#146;s US subsidiary (then called UPC Uranium (USA) Inc. and now
	called Energy Fuels Wyoming Inc.) became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Titan. The
	remaining 50% of the Sheep Mountain Project was owned by Uranium One Inc.
	(
<B>
	&#147;U1&#148;
</B>
	) which was UPC&#146;s joint venture partner for the project. On October
	1, 2009, Titan acquired U1&#146;s 50% interest, giving Titan a 100% interest in the
	Sheep Mountain Project. On February 29, 2012, Energy Fuels acquired Titan (and
	its subsidiaries) at which point the Sheep Mountain Project became 100% owned by
	the Company.

	The Sheep Mountain Project was operated as an underground and
	open pit mine at various times in the 1970&#146;s and 1980&#146;s. 5,063,813 tons of
	mineralized material were mined and milled, yielding 17,385,116 pounds of

	Uranium was first discovered in the Crooks Gap District, which
	includes the Sheep Mountain Project, in 1953 (Bendix, 1982). While the original
	discoveries were aided by aerial and ground radiometric surveys, exploration
	activities were primarily related to drilling and exploratory trenching. Three
	companies dominated the district by the mid-1950&#146;s: Western Nuclear Inc.

	and Continental Uranium Corporation (
<B>
	&#147;Continental&#148;

	). Western Nuclear
	built the Split Rock mill at Jeffrey City in 1957 and initiated production from
	the Paydirt pit in 1961, Golden Goose 1 in 1966, and Golden Goose 2 in 1970.
	Phelps Dodge was the principal shareholder and operator of the Green Mountain
	Uranium Corporation&#146;s Ravine Mine which began production in 1956. Continental
	developed the Seismic Pit in 1956, the Seismic Mine in 1957, the Reserve Mine in
	1961, and the Congo Decline in 1968. In 1967, Continental acquired the Phelps
	Dodge properties and in 1972, Western Nuclear acquired all of Continental&#146;s
	Crooks Gap holdings. During the mid-1970&#146;s Phelps Dodge acquired an interest in
	Western Nuclear which began work on the Sheep Mountain I in 1974, the McIntosh
	Pit in 1975, and Sheep Mountain II in 1976. Western Nuclear ceased production
	from the area in 1982. Western Nuclear production from the Sheep Mountain I is

	In 2006, UPC completed a drilling program consisting of 19
	holes totaling 12,072 feet. Two of the 19 holes were located in Section 28 with
	the purpose of confirming the mineralization within the Sheep Underground mine
	area. The remaining 17 holes were completed in the planned Congo Pit to test
	both shallow mineralization and to explore a deeper mineralized horizon. This
	2006 drilling has confirmed the presence of mineralization in the shallow
	horizons of the Congo Pit area and has identified and extended roll front
	mineralization in the 58 sand along strike.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Following the acquisition of UPC by Titan, five holes were
	drilled in the Congo Pit area in 2009 for a total of 1,700 feet. In situ mineral
	grades for 2009 drilling were determined by geophysical logging including both
	conventional gamma logging and state of the art Uranium Spectrum Analysis Tool.
	Titan also drilled in the Congo Pit area in 2010 62 exploratory drill holes and
	5 monitor wells and 2011 73 exploratory drill holes and 5 monitor wells. There
	were a total of 140 exploration holes drilled between 2009 and 2011, which total
	about 44,000 feet.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	No relevant exploration work other than this drilling has been
	conducted on the property in recent years. The project is located within a
	brownfield site which has experienced past mine production and extensive
	exploration and development drilling. The initial discovery was based on aerial
	and ground radiometric surveys in the 1950's, but since that time exploratory
	work on the site has been primarily drilling.

	Most of the mineralization in the Crooks Gap District occurs in
	roll-front deposits. Roll fronts have an erratic linear distribution but are
	usually concordant with the bedding. Deposits have been discovered from the
	surface down to a depth of 1,500 feet. The two major uranium minerals are
	uranophane and autunite. Exploration drilling indicated that the deeper
	roll-type deposits are concentrated in synclinal troughs in the lower Battle
	Spring Formation. Three possible sources for uranium have been suggested:
	post-Eocene tuffaceous sediments, leached Battle Spring arkoses, and Precambrian
	granites. Structural controls of uranium occurrences along roll fronts include
	carbonaceous siltstone beds that provide a local reducing environment for
	precipitation of uranium-bearing minerals, and abrupt changes in permeability
	along faults, where impermeable gouge is in contact with permeable sandstones.
	Uranium has also been localized along the edges of stream channels and at
	contacts with carbonaceous shales

	The Sheep Mountain Project includes the Congo Pit, a proposed
	open pit uranium extraction facility, and the reopening of the existing Sheep
	Underground mining facility. Mineral Extraction at the Sheep Underground mining
	facility was suspended
	in 1988 and the project has been on care and maintenance since that time.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Sheep Mountain Project does not currently have a processing
	facility. Transportation of mineralized materials to the White Mesa Mill is not
	economic at current or foreseeable uranium price levels. As a result, it will be
	necessary to permit and construct a heap leach or other processing facility at
	the site, or make arrangements to process Sheep Mountain mineralized materials
	at a third party processing facility.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company is subject to liabilities for mine and exploration
	reclamation at the Sheep Mountain project. The Company maintains four (4) bonds
	with the State of Wyoming as security for these liabilities. The Company files
	annual reports with the State of Wyoming, and the amount of the bonds may be
	adjusted annually to ensure sufficient surety is in place to cover the full cost
	of reclamation. The Company&#146;s reclamation of the exploration drilling performed
	by Titan was deemed complete in October 2014; the drilling permit was terminated
	and that bond was fully released.

	The Sheep Mountain Project was acquired by the Company in
	February 2012, through the Company&#146;s acquisition of Titan. As of December 31,

</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Road access to the Henry Mountains Complex is by paved Highway
	276, running between Hanksville and Bullfrog Basin Marina, Utah. An unimproved
	gravel road maintained by Garfield County extends west from Highway 276, passes
	by the portal of the Tony M Property, and extends northerly across the property,
	the northern end of which is crossed by another county road. The property is
	located in a relatively remote area of Utah, and the infrastructure is limited.
	The town site of Ticaboo, Utah, is located approximately five miles south of the
	property. It has been used to provide housing and municipal services for Tony M
	Property staff. The next closest community is Hanksville, Utah, a small town of
	a few hundred people, located about 40 miles north of the property. During
	operation of the Tony M Property, electricity was generated locally. Materials
	and supplies are transported to the site by truck about 275 miles from Salt Lake
	City, and about 190 miles from Grand Junction, Colorado. The distance to the
	White Mesa Mill is about 117 miles.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The climate is distinctly arid, with an average annual
	precipitation of approximately eight inches, including about 12 inches of snow.
	The vegetation consists primarily of small plants including some of the major
	varieties of blackbrush, sagebrush, and rabbit brush. A few small junipers are
	also present. Relief over the combined Henry Mountains Complex is approximately
	2,250 feet (the technical report erroneously reported 800 feet). The elevation
	on the property ranges from 4,550 ft. above sea level at the portal of the Tony
	M Property, near the southern end of the property, to 6,800 ft. above sea level
	over the northern end of the property. The terrain is typical canyon lands
	topography, with some areas deeply dissected by gullies and headwalls of canyons
	and the rest consisting of gently undulating gravel benches covering the
	northern part of the project area. The terrain in several parts of the property
	is particularly rugged and inaccessible and is the primary reason for the
	irregular pattern of surface drill holes in parts of the property.

	Ownership
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Henry Mountains Complex is 100% owned by Energy Fuels, and
	was acquired from Denison Mines Corp. and its affiliates in June 2012. The
	project consists of one Utah State Mineral Lease for Section 16, Township 35
	South, Range 11 East (T35S R11E), Salt Lake Meridian (SLM), and 202 unpatented
	federal lode mining claims. The latter consist of 137 B.F., 19 Bull, 19 Star,
	two Frog claims (comprising the Bullfrog Property), and 17 TIC and eight Ticaboo
	claims, including fractions (comprising the Tony M property). The claims and
	state lease comprise one contiguous property located in T34S, R11E and T35S,
	R11E, SLM. The Utah State Section 16 includes 638.54 acres, and the 202
	unpatented lode mining claims consist of about 3,667.18 acres (not specified in
	the technical report), for a total land holding of 4,305.72 acres. The surface
	rights are owned by the federal government, administered by the BLM, with the
	exception of the state lease which has associated state surface rights.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	There is no royalty burden for the 185 claims that comprise the
	Bullfrog Property, as well as for the Ticaboo claims. All unpatented mining
	claims are subject to an annual federal mining claim maintenance fee of $155 per
	claim plus approximately $10 per claim for county filing fees. The 17 TIC claims
	are held by Energy Fuels, subject to an annual advance minimum royalty. The
	uranium production royalty burden is 4% yellowcake gross value less taxes and
	certain other deductions. The vanadium production royalty burden is 2% gross
	value less certain deductions. The Utah State Lease carries an annual rental of
	$640, plus an escalating annual advance minimum royalty based on the uranium
	spot price. Since the technical report was written, the state lease was renewed
	in 2015 for an additional 10 year term, which can be extended. Other changes in
	the renewed lease include reducing annual advanced royalty payments and
	crediting the advanced royalty against the production royalty for the year in
	which it is paid plus any amount paid in the five prior years. The uranium
	royalty on the State lease is 8% of gross value less certain deductions. The vanadium royalty is 4%
	of gross value less certain deductions.

	Tony M Property:
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The original Tony M Property mine permit was allowed to lapse.
	Subsequently the previous operator, Denison, filed for exploration permits with
	the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (
<B>
	&#147;UDOGM&#148;
</B>
	) and the BLM. These
	permits were granted by UDOGM and the BLM on December 2, 2005 and March 6, 2006,
	respectively, which enabled Denison to regain access, inspect and begin
	rehabilitation of the Tony M underground workings. Denison also began the
	permitting process for the Tony M Property. The permit application was submitted
	in November 2006 and a Record of Decision (
<B>
	&#147;RoD&#148;
</B>
	) and approved PO were
	received in September 2007.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The PO was challenged by the Center for Water Advocacy and the
	Utah Chapter of the Sierra Club, which requested a Utah State BLM Director
	Review and a stay of the decision approving the Final PO for the Tony M
	Property. On November 21, 2007, the BLM State Director issued a decision
	vacating the previously issued permit and remanded the case to the Field Office
	in order that the EA for the Tony M Mine PO could be amended and a new RoD
	issued. As a result of this decision to vacate and renew, the request for stay
	was considered moot. The new decision was issued by the BLM on November 23, 2007
	approving the PO for the project. The new decision was once again appealed by
	the Center for Water Advocacy and the Utah Chapter of the Sierra Club. The Utah
	State Director issued a decision denying the appeal and upholding the PO on
	February 19, 2008. In addition to the PO and FONSI from the BLM, major permits
	for the Tony M property include an approved Large Mine permit with UDOGM, and
	an approved ground water discharge permit with the Utah Division of Water
	Quality (
<B>
	&#147;DWQ&#148;
</B>
	). A reclamation bond of $708,537 is in place.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Permit applications for a Phase 2 expansion were submitted to
	the BLM and UDOGM in 2008. The expansion was approved by the UDOGM in 2009, but

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Exposed rocks in the project area are Jurassic and Cretaceous
	in age. Host rocks for the Copper Bench-Indian Bench and Tony M-Southwest
	uranium-vanadium deposits are Upper Jurassic sandstones of the Salt Wash Member
	of the Morrison Formation. This formation is located within the Colorado
	Plateau. Early Tertiary fluvial and lacustrine sedimentation within the deeper
	parts of local basins was followed in mid-Tertiary time by laccolithic intrusion
	and extensive volcanism. Intrusions of diorite and monazite porphyry penetrated
	the sediments at several sites to form the laccolithic mountains of the central
	Colorado Plateau.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Morrison Formation is a complex fluvial deposit of Late
	Jurassic age. In outcrop, the Salt Wash is exposed as one or more massive,
	ledge-forming sandstones, generally interbedded with laterally persistent
	siltstones or mudstones. The lower Salt Wash is approximately 150 ft. thick in
	the Project area, thinning and becoming less sandy northward from the project
	area. Sandstones comprise 80% of the sequence, with siltstones and mudstones
	making up the remainder. Significant uranium mineralization occurs only in this
	lower unit.

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 1970 and 1971, Rioamex Corporation conducted a 40-hole
	drilling program in an east-west zone extending across the southerly end of the
	Bullfrog Property and the northerly end of the Tony M and adjacent Frank M
	properties. Some of these holes intercepted significant uranium mineralization.
	The Bullfrog deposit was initially explored by Exxon Minerals Company
	(
<B>
	&#147;Exxon&#148;
</B>
	), while the Tony M deposit was explored and advanced by Plateau
	Resources Ltd. (
<B>
	&#147;Plateau&#148;
</B>
	), a subsidiary of Consumers Power Company
	(
<B>
	&#147;Consumers&#148;
</B>
	) of Michigan.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In February 1977, drilling commenced in what was to become the
	Tony M deposit. Subsequently, Plateau drilled more than 2,000 rotary drill holes
	totaling about 1,000,000 feet. Over 1,200 holes were drilled in the Tony M area.
	Following the discovery of the Tony M deposit in 1977, Plateau constructed the
	Tony M Property from September 1, 1977, to about May 1984, at which time mining
	activities were suspended. By January 31, 1983, over 18 miles of underground
	workings were developed at the Tony M Property, and a total of approximately
	237,000 tons of mineralized material was extracted with an average chemically
	adjusted grade of 0.121%

	The underground workings at the
	Tony M Property are accessed via two parallel declines extending about 10,200
	ft. into the deposit. The underground workings were allowed to flood after
	mining activities were suspended in 1984. The southern one-half of the
	underground workings remained dry, as they are located above the static water
	table.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Exxon commenced drilling on the Bullfrog Property in 1977.
	Before it sold the property to Atlas in July 1982, Exxon had drilled 1,782
	holes. From July 1982 to July 1983, Atlas completed 112 drill holes delineating
	the Southwest and Copper Bench deposits on approximately 100 ft. centers. After
	July 1983, Atlas completed an additional 49 core hole drilling program
	throughout the Bullfrog Property, as well as a 133 rotary drill hole program to
	delineate the Indian Bench deposit on approximately 200 ft. centers. A total of
	2,232 drill holes were completed on the Bullfrog Property.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Southwest and Copper Bench deposits are delineated by
	drilling on approximately 100 foot centers. The Indian Bench deposit is
	delineated by drilling on approximately 200 ft. centers. In some areas, the
	rugged terrain made access difficult, resulting in an irregular drill pattern.
	Records indicate that a total of 81 core holes were drilled in the Southwest,
	Copper Bench, and Indian Bench deposits, while 25 core holes were drilled in the
	vicinity of the Tony M deposit. The core holes provided samples of the
	mineralized zone for chemical and amenability testing.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Denison acquired the Bullfrog Property when it purchased most
	of the assets of EFN in 1997. In February 2005, Denison acquired the Tony M
	Property bringing it under common ownership with the Bullfrog Property.
	Following rehabilitation work at the Tony M Property and re-establishment of
	surface facilities in 2006, Denison received operational permits, reopened the
	Tony M underground workings and commenced mining activities in September 2007.
	This work included a long-hole drilling program to discover and delineate
	mineralization within about 100 feet of underground workings. In November 2008,
	Denison announced that mining activities at the Tony M Property would be
	suspended due to uranium and economic market conditions. During its September
	2007 to December 2008 reactivation, cleanup and mining activities, Denison
	extracted 162,384 tons of mineralized material at radiometric grade of 0.131%

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Uranium mineralization in the Henry Mountains Complex is hosted
	by favorable sandstone horizons containing detrital organic debris.
	Mineralization primarily consists of coffinite, with minor uraninite which
	usually occurs in close association with vanadium mineralization. Mineralization
	occurs as intergranular disseminations, as well as coatings and/or cement on and
	between sand grains and organic debris. Vanadium occurs as montroseite (hydrous
	vanadium oxide) and vanadium chlorite in primary mineralized zones located below
	the water table (i.e., the northern portion of the Tony M deposit). Historic
	production records from the AEC for the South Henry Mountains district suggest
	that the vanadium content of the district is relatively low. Based on the review

	Present Condition of the Property and Work Completed to Date

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following section has been prepared by the Company and
	is not based exclusively on the Henry Mountains Technical Report.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Tony M Property was developed from 1977 to 1983 with a
	double entry system including two parallel declines spaced 50 ft. apart. The
	declines measure 9 feet by 12 feet in cross- section, have crosscuts on 50 foot
	centers, have a minus 3% grade, serve as the primary fresh air intake, and are
	10,200 feet in length. By January 31, 1983, over 18 miles of underground
	workings had been developed at the Tony M Property. The underground workings were allowed to flood after
	mining activities were suspended in 1984. The southern one-half of the
	underground workings remained dry, as they are located above the static water
	table.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The underground workings were planned as a random room and
	pillar approach with pillar extraction by a retreat system. Mining equipment
	consisted of slushers and rubber-tired, five- to ten-ton capacity load-haul-dump
	units. Exhaust ventilation was provided by five bored ventilation shafts, six
	feet in diameter, each with a 75-HP exhaust fan mounted at the shaft collar.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	By early 2007, work on reactivating the Tony M Property was
	carried out by Denison, and surface and underground rehabilitation and repairs
	were conducted. Surface facilities to support mining activities were
	constructed, including administration and maintenance facilities, site power and
	communications, and an evaporation pond for evaporation of water from the
	underground workings. Worker housing was established in the town of Ticaboo,
	Utah. As rehabilitation work advanced, ventilation was
	re-established. The water level in the underground workings had risen to
	historic pre-mining activity levels, and upon reaching the flooded workings,
	dewatering activities were also initiated. During the rehabilitation work,
	limited amounts of &#147;cleanup mineralized material&#148; were removed. As areas of the
	underground workings were made ready for mining activities, extraction of
	mineralized materials increased steadily. Dewatering continued at an average
	rate of 125 gallons per minute during these activities. Denison placed the Tony
	M Property on temporary closure status at the end of November 2008. The project
	is being maintained in a state ready to resume operations as market conditions
	warrant. Staff have been retained at the site to keep the property in a ready
	state.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	There is no existing infrastructure on the Bullfrog Property.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Henry Mountains Complex was acquired by the Company in June
	2012, through the acquisition of the US Mining Division from Denison. The cost of the
	Henry Mountains Complex has been fully impaired, and as of December 31, 2015, the total cost attributable to the Henry Mountains

	Unless stated otherwise concerning land tenure and permitting

	Project is derived from a technical report titled "Technical Report on La Sal
	District Project (Including the Pandora, Beaver, and Energy Queen Projects), San
	Juan County, Utah, U.S.A.", dated March 25, 2014, prepared by Douglas C. Peters,
	CPG, of Peters Geosciences, in accordance with NI 43-101 (the &#147;
<B>
	La Sal
	Technical Report
</B>
	&#148;). The La Sal Technical Report includes an updated NI
	43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate. The author of the La Sal Technical
	Report is a &#147;qualified person&#148; and &#147;independent&#148; of the Company within the
	meaning of NI 43-101. A copy of the La Sal Technical Report is available on

	EDGAR at

	. The La
	Sal Project does not have known reserves, and is therefore considered under SEC
	Industry Guide 7 definitions to be exploratory in nature, despite uranium
	extraction activities occurring as recently as 2012.

	Project Description &amp; Location
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The La Sal Project is an underground project that consists of
	four mineral properties within close proximity of one another, including (from
	east-to-west) the Pandora (Snowball) Property, the Beaver (La Sal) Property, the
	Redd Block Property, and the Energy Queen Property. The La Sal Project is
	located in San Juan County, Utah near the town of La Sal. Other properties
	within the La Sal Project (but not described in the La Sal Technical Report)
	include the Pine Ridge property, east of the Pandora property, and unpatented
	mining claims west of the Energy Queen Property.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The La Sal trend, which includes the La Sal Project, has a long
	history of uranium and vanadium production. Deposits from this district have
	been successfully milled at several historic mills in the region including Union
	Carbide&#146;s (Umetco's) mill at Uravan, Colorado, the Climax Uranium mill in Grand
	Junction, Colorado, the Atlas mill at Moab, Utah and Energy Fuels&#146; White Mesa
	Mill near Blanding, Utah.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Operations at the La Sal Project are currently on standby. The
	extraction of all resources at the La Sal Project have been by conventional
	underground methods for over 40 years and, once mining activity resumes, will
	continue by such methods. These methods have been used very successfully in the
	region for over 100 years. The nature of the Salt Wash uranium-vanadium deposits
	require a random room and pillar mining configuration. The deposits are accessed
	from the surface via declines depending on the depth to mineralization and
	geologically suitable sites for portals, as is the case for the La Sal and
	Pandora/Snowball Properties. Deposits may also be accessed through vertical
	shafts, such as the shafts located at the Beaver and Energy Queen Properties.
	The Salt Wash uranium deposits are usually thinner than the underground height
	needed for personnel and equipment access. Therefore, the mineralized material
	is often extracted by employing a split-shooting method, which serves to
	separate mineralized material and waste as it is broken.

	The La Sal Project is easily accessed from the all-weather Utah
	State Highway 46. Utah 46 enters the project land near the southwest corner of
	ML-49313 (Section 36, T28S, R24E) about three miles east of the intersection of
	Utah 46 with U.S. Highway 191 at La Sal Junction. Utah 46 stays within or very
	near the project land for the next 9 miles to the east. All State and U.S.
	highways in this area are paved roads.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The area is semi-arid. Temperatures range between an average
	low of 41&deg;F to an average high of 72&deg;F. Less than ten
	inches of precipitation falls per year. Winters are not severe, although there
	are numerous snow storms, the temperature drops below 0&deg;F at times,
	and snow can accumulate to over a foot in the lower areas and more than two feet
	at times on Pine Ridge. The region of the La Sal Project central area is
	characterized by a broad shallow valley of hay fields and pasturelands at an
	elevation between 6,400 and 7,000 feet. Hills cut by small canyons occur at the
	west end and even higher elevations of about 7,800 feet are reached at Pine
	Ridge on the east end. All elevations within four miles of the center and west
	end of the property support moderate growths of sage and rabbitbrush along with
	other brush, forbs, cactus, yucca, and grasses. Higher elevations contain
	juniper and pi&#241;on pine in the rocky soils along with scrub oak, aspen, and
	ponderosa pine on Pine Ridge to the east.

	La Sal, Utah is a small town, currently home to about 200
	people. It has been a hub to area ranchers, uranium and copper miners, and oil
	and gas workers for many years. Larger population centers of Moab and
	Monticello, Utah are 22 miles north and 34 miles south, respectively, from La
	Sal Junction on Highway 191. Before the cessation of mining activities at the
	Beaver and Pandora Properties in late 2012, many of the workers also came from
	the Nucla-Naturita and the Dove Creek areas of Colorado, each about 55 miles
	away to the east and south, respectively. Larger cities with industrial supply
	houses include Cortez, Colorado about 100 miles to the south and Grand Junction,
	Colorado about 140 miles to the north.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Electric transmission and distribution lines exist throughout
	the project area, of sufficient size to supply the load the projects demanded in
	the past. Several substations exist, and the electricity supply is adequate for

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The La Sal Project is held by Energy Fuels&#146; subsidiary, EFR
	Colorado Plateau LLC under private surface use and access leases, private
	mineral leases, Utah State Mineral Leases, San Juan County surface use, access,
	and mineral lease, and, after the Company reduced the property position by
	dropping claims without affecting the Mineral Resource, 219 unpatented mining
	claims on land managed by the BLM or USFS, that are either owned by Energy Fuels
	(90 claims) or leased by Energy Fuels (129 claims). After the claim drop, the
	total land package now consists of approximately 9,260 acres. The unpatented
	claims cover about 3,350 acres, the seven Utah State leases total approximately
	2,220 acres, the San Juan County leased land contains just over 263 acres, and
	the six separate surface access and nine private parcel mineral leases apply to
	a total of 3,430 acres. The property covers all, or parts of the following
	Sections: Sections 31, 32, and 33, T28S, R25E; Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7, T29S,
	R25E; Sections 25, 26, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36, T28S, R24E; Sections 1, 2, 3,

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Annual holding costs consist of rental fees to the BLM at $155
	per year per claim, due on or before September 1st each year. An affidavit of
	the payment to the BLM must be filed with the appropriate County each year for a
	nominal fee of about $10 per claim. This applies to all unpatented claims
	whether owned or leased by Energy Fuels. Annual holding costs for State leases
	and private leases vary, ranging between $500 and $13,500 for State Leases and
	$480 and $20,340 for private leases. The Company is also required to pay
	production royalties at varying rates for unpatented mining claims and private
	leases. The Utah State production royalties are fixed at 8% on uranium and 4% on
	vanadium.

	extraction of up to 250 tons per day (

	) of mineralized materials.
	Water discharge permits to allow initial and ongoing discharge of water from

	initiated permitting plans for additional facility expansion in 2012, but then
	deferred these plans when the Redd Block IV resource was acquired in the Denison
	acquisition. Engineering studies are being conducted to determine if the
	Redd Block IV resource can be extracted from the Energy Queen shaft and surface
	facilities. If this proves to be the case, the Energy Queen UDOGM permit would
	be updated to include the Redd Block IV area as well as other resources that
	have been acquired since the 2009 amendment. A Small Source Exemption that is in
	place for air emissions would also need to be replaced with an air permit
	because of the increased surface disturbance.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Colorado Plateau covers nearly 130,000 square miles in the
	Four Corners region of the U.S. The La Sal Project and other properties held by
	Energy Fuels lie in the Canyon Lands Section in the central and east-central
	part of the Colorado Plateau in Utah and Colorado. The Colorado Plateau&#146;s
	basement rocks are mostly Proterozoic metamorphics and igneous intrusions. The
	area was relatively stable throughout much of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras
	with minor uplifts, subsidences, and tiltings resulting in fairly flat-lying
	sedimentary rocks ranging from evaporites, limestones, and marine clastic
	sediments, through eolian sandstones, to detritus of fluvial systems.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The significant uranium deposits in the La Sal Project occur in
	the late Jurassic Morrison Formation. The Morrison comprises two members in the
	La Sal area. The lower member, the Salt Wash, is the main uranium host. The
	upper part of the Morrison is the Brushy Basin Member; it is from 350 to 450
	feet thick. The Salt Wash, approximately 300 feet thick, consists of about equal
	amounts of fluvial sandstones and mudstones deposited by meandering river
	systems flowing generally toward the east. The Brushy Basin was deposited mostly
	on a large mud flat, probably with many lakes and streams. Much of the material
	deposited to form the Brushy Basin originated from volcanic activity to the
	west. The majority of the recovered uranium has come from the upper sandstones
	of the Salt Wash Member known as the Top Rim (historically referred to as the
	&#147;ore-bearing sandstone&#148; or OBSS), which ranges from about 60 feet to 100 feet
	thick.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Light-brown and gray sandstones and conglomerates of the
	200-foot thick Cretaceous Burro Canyon Formation overlie the Brushy Basin. These
	crop out in the eastern part of the La Sal Project (over the Pine Ridge,
	Pandora, and La Sal/Snowball properties). This formation contains interbedded
	green and purplish mudstones with a few thin limestone beds. The Burro Canyon
	Formation is exposed covering the Brushy Basin at the west end of the La Sal
	Project, on the State sections and claims west of the Energy Queen. Locally,
	silicification altered the limestones to chert and some of the sandstones to
	orthoquartzite. Orthoquartzite cobbles and boulders litter the Brushy Basin
	slopes. In the central part of the La Sal Project (Beaver, Redd Block, and
	Energy Queen), the Burro Canyon is covered by a layer of alluvium and gravels
	shed from the La Sal Mountains to the north. These gravels vary in thickness
	from a thin veneer to over 120 feet thick.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The La Sal District uranium-vanadium deposits are similar to
	those elsewhere in the Uravan Mineral Belt. Host rocks within the areas
	surrounding the La Sal Project consist of oxidized sediments of the Morrison
	Formation, exhibiting red, hematite-rich clastic rocks. Individual deposits are
	localized in areas of reduced, gray sandstone and gray or green mudstone (Thamm,
	et al., 1981). The Morrison sediments accumulated as oxidized detritus in the
	fluvial environment. However, there were isolated environments where reduced
	conditions existed, such as oxbow lakes and carbon-rich point bars. During early
	burial and diagenesis, the through-flowing ground water within the large,
	saturated pile of Salt Wash and Brushy Basin material remained oxidized, thereby
	transporting uranium in solution. When the uranium-rich waters encountered the
	zones of trapped reduced waters, the uranium precipitated. Therefore, deposits
	vary greatly in thickness, grade, size, and shape. Vanadium may have been
	leached from iron-titanium mineral grains and subsequently deposited along with,
	or prior, to the uranium.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Numerous underground mines near outcrops in the eastern part of
	the La Sal trend (in the La Sal Creek Canyon District) were mined for vanadium
	during the early 1900s. Sometime after World War II (approximately 1948-1954), exploration work on Morrison Formation outcrops in the
	west end of the district resulted in the discovery of the Rattlesnake mine (open
	pit) two miles west-southwest of the Energy Queen shaft. Deeper deposits of the
	central La Sal trend (in the area of the La Sal Project) were discovered in the
	1960s and developed for production in the 1970s through vertical shafts and
	declines. The La Sal Project and La Sal Creek District production, through 1980,
	amounted to about 6,426,000 pounds U

	The Pandora Property was operated by Atlas Minerals in the
	1970s and early 1980s. Umetco Minerals (Union Carbide) operated the Snowball, La
	Sal, and Beaver properties during the same time period. The Energy Queen
	property, then known as the Hecla Shaft, was started in 1979 by the Union
	Carbide/Hecla Joint Venture. The Energy Queen stopped mining activities in 1983
	due to inadequate uranium prices. GEUMCO (General Electric Uranium Mining
	Company) operated the Pine Ridge property in the late 1970s, producing from a
	sandstone lens in the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation. Pine Ridge
	was acquired by Minerals Recovery Corporation in 1981 which developed a decline
	to the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation, but halted mining activities
	before any significant extraction of mineralized materials. A small project
	conducted mining activities in the eastern part of Section 2 (ML-49596) during
	the early 1980s. The amount of uranium extracted from this project is unknown.
	Low uranium and vanadium prices forced all mining activities throughout the
	district to cease about 1991. Mineralized materials from these projects have
	been successfully processed at the Company&#146;s currently operating White Mesa

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The uranium- and vanadium-bearing minerals occur as fine
	grained coatings on the detrital grains. They fill pore spaces between the sand
	grains, and they replace some carbonaceous material and detrital quartz and
	feldspar grains. The primary uranium mineral is uraninite (pitchblende)
	(UO
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	) with minor amounts of coffinite (USiO
<SUB>
	4
</SUB>
	OH).
	Montroseite (VOOH) is the primary vanadium mineral, along with vanadium
	clays and hydromica. Traces of metallic sulfides occur. In outcrops and shallow
	oxidized areas of older mines in the surrounding areas, the minerals now exposed
	are the calcium and potassium uranyl vanadates, tyuyamunite, and carnotite.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Some stoping areas in the Beaver/La Sal and Pandora/Snowball
	Properties are well over 1,000 feet long and several hundred feet wide. The
	Indicated Mineral Resources of the Redd Block and Energy Queen Properties
	identified through drilling are of similar size. Individual mineralized beds
	vary in thickness from several inches to over 6 feet. Throughout much of the La
	Sal district there are three horizons in the Top Rim that host the
	mineralization. They are 25-40 feet apart.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Kovschak and Nylund (1981) report no apparent disequilibrium
	problems in the other mining episodes of the La Sal area. Mining activities and
	milling by Denison and Energy Fuels shows that well-calibrated gamma probes
	equate well to the mill head grades indicating no significant disequilibrium
	exists. This is generally true of the Salt Wash uranium deposits because of the
	age of the mineralization and the hydrologic history of the host rocks.
	Therefore, Energy Fuels has no reason to anticipate any disequilibrium
	conditions within the unmined portions of the deposits on the project property.

	Since the La Sal Project covers a length of ten miles and

<I>
	Project Location and Description
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Daneros Project is an underground project located in the
	Red Canyon portion of the White Canyon District, Utah, approximately 65 miles
	west of the White Mesa Mill. The Company holds a 100% interest in various groups
	of mining claims, including Daneros and adjoining historical sites which can be
	developed in conjunction with the Daneros Project.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The previous owner of the Daneros Project, Utah Energy
	Corporation (
<B>
	&#147;UEC&#148;
</B>
	), gathered the necessary environmental data and
	obtained the approvals to open an underground uranium project in May 2009. UEC
	commenced active mining activities, including constructing a decline into the
	main Daneros deposit. The first loads of mineralized material from the Daneros
	Project were delivered to the White Mesa Mill in December 2009, and a toll
	milling campaign was conducted in the second half of 2010. The Daneros Project
	was acquired by the Company in June 2012 along with all of Denison&#146;s U.S.
	Mining Division. Prior to being placed on standby in October 2012, mineralized
	material from the Daneros Project was delivered to the White Mesa Mill and
	processed for Energy Fuels&#146; account.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The extraction of all resources in the Daneros Project is by
	conventional underground methods. These methods have been used successfully in
	the region for over 70 years. The nature of the Shinarump uranium deposits
	requires a random room and pillar mining configuration. The deposits have
	irregular shapes and occur within several close-spaced, flat or slight-dipping
	horizons. Uranium mineralization often rolls between horizons. The use of
	rubber-tired equipment allows the workers to follow the mineralized material
	easily in the slight dips and to ramp up or down to the other horizons. The
	deposit is accessed from the surface through a 450 feet decline at a gradient of
	-15%. The Shinarump deposits are usually thinner than the underground height
	needed for personnel and equipment access. Therefore, the mineralized material
	is extracted by a split-shooting method. The project also employs an underground
	long-hole exploration drilling program, reaching out as much as 400 feet ahead
	of and adjacent to the workings, as guided by the project geologist.

<I>
	Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and
	Physiography
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Daneros Project is located 4.8 miles from Fry Canyon, Utah
	and is accessed via Radium King Road, which is maintained by San Juan County,
	approximately 14 miles south of Utah Highway 95. The bench
	above the project facilities, where past drilling also had been conducted, is
	accessed by a dirt road connecting to the project access road south of the
	underground workings portal area. Electric power is generated on site. The
	shipping distance from the Daneros Project to the White Mesa Mill is about 65
	miles.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The semi-arid climate of the White Canyon area is characterized
	by large daily and yearly temperature ranges and total annual precipitation of
	approximately 10 to 16 inches, mostly as sporadic, intense summer thunderstorms
	typical of the Colorado Plateau region. Winter snowfall is moderate and rarely
	stays on the ground very long. Weather conditions pose no impediment to year
	round work on the project.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Apart from previous mining activities, the only commercial land
	use purposes are cattle grazing and tourism activities such as hiking and
	mountain biking. Due to a shortage of water and thin soils, much of the White
	Canyon area is unsuitable for agriculture.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The project area is remotely located relative to water and
	power infrastructure. Housing for workers is mostly in camp trailers in Fry
	Canyon, or they commute from Blanding, Utah 65-miles to the east or farther.
	Blanding is a town large enough to host regional industrial activities,
	including stores and supply houses of sufficient size and inventory to meet most
	of the needs of an operation the size of the Daneros Project.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The project area is located along a north-south trending canyon
	which is a tributary to Red Canyon, also known as Bullseye Canyon. The Red
	Canyon drainage flows westerly for approximately 25 miles to the Colorado River
	where it joins Lake Powell at the head of Good Hope Bay. The project portal area
	comprises steeply sloping, rocky ground and scree along the eastern slope of
	Bullseye Canyon. Very steep to vertical, and at times overhanging, cliffs 400
	feet high rise from the slope about 250 feet above the portal.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Vegetation in the project area consists of sagebrush, juniper
	and pi&#241;on in the hills and slopes, while desert grasses, forbs, and shrubs are
	evident within the valley floors and on the mesa tops. Elevations in the region
	range from about 5,300 feet at the Fry Canyon townsite to over 7,000 feet on the
	surrounding mesa tops. The project portal is at about 5,750 feet above sea
	level.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<I>
	Ownership
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Daneros Project is owned by the Company&#146;s subsidiary EFR
	White Canyon Corp. Since the Daneros Project Technical Report was written, the
	Company has reduced the property position around the periphery of the project,
	without affecting the Mineral Resource as described in the Daneros Project
	Technical Report. We have also added a Utah State mineral lease of 640 acres in
	Section 32, T36S, R16E to the project which is not included in the technical
	report.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The property now consists of 141 unpatented mining claims
	located on federal land administered by the BLM in San Juan County, Utah, plus
	the State lease totaling approximately 3,450 acres. The property lies in
	Sections 1, (11, and 12 were dropped in 2014) T37S, R15E, SLM, Sections (4
	dropped in 2014), 5, 6, 7, 8, (10, 11, 15, 17 dropped in 2014), and 18, T37S,
	R16E (and Section 31 and 33, T36S, R16E dropped in 2014).

<A NAME="eolPage101"></A>
<A NAME="FORM10K_HTM_PAGE_101">
</A>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The mining claims are maintained by making annual payments of
	US $155 per claim per year to BLM due September 1st each year, along with a
	nominal filing fee paid to the county within 30 days of the BLM filing of about
	$10 per claim. Work expenditures are not required. Holders of unpatented mining
	claims are generally granted surface access to conduct mineral exploration and
	mining activities. However, additional mine permits and plans are generally
	required prior to conducting exploration or mining activities on such claims.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A number of the claims bear production royalties. Claims
	hosting the Daneros deposit are subject to royalties ranging between 15% of
	"market value" of the mineralized material and 2.5% of gross proceeds as
	described in further detail in the Daneros Mine Technical report. Other claims
	are owned by the Company without encumbrances. The State lease added since the
	Daneros Project Technical Report carries the standard Utah royalty of 8% on
	uranium and 4% on vanadium.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Sufficient surface rights are in place for contemplated mining
	activities and waste storage. Since no milling activities are contemplated on
	the Daneros Project, no areas are required for tailings storage, heap leach
	pads, or processing plant sites.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<I>
	Permitting
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The primary permits required for mining activities at the
	Daneros Project include a Large Mine NOI issued by UDOGM and a PO approved by
	the BLM. The PO required document preparation and public notice of an EA. The
	permits obtained by UEC were for the initial stage of mining activities and
	contemplated eventual expansion of the mining activities, with the inclusion of
	additional surface area for support facilities. The Daneros Project does not
	discharge any water, so no discharge permit is required.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Following approval of the PO by the BLM, an appeal of the BLM
	approval was filed by Uranium Watch and associated non-government organizations.
	The appeal was ultimately denied by the Utah BLM State office, and appealed to
	the Department of Interior Board of Land Appeals, which denied the appeal on
	September 26, 2012.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Permitting for project expansion began in 2012 with the
	submittal of a construction application to the Utah Division of Air Quality
	(
<B>
	&#147;UDAQ&#148;
</B>
	) and EPA for radon emissions. This application, which was
	approved in 2
<SUP>
	nd
</SUP>
	Quarter 2012 requires monitoring and annual reporting
	of radon emissions from the project&#146;s ventilation system. An air permit
	application was submitted to UDAQ for other regulated air emissions (e.g.,
	fugitive dust, volatile organic compounds) and approved in 4
<SUP>
	th
</SUP>
	Quarter 2012. In 1
<SUP>
	st
</SUP>
	Quarter 2013, an amended PO and a Large Mine NOI
	were submitted to the BLM and UDOGM, respectively. An EA is currently being
	conducted for the proposed Project expansion. The Company expects these
	amendments to be approved in&nbsp; late 2016.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Exploration Notices have also been approved for brown fields
	drilling around the Daneros Project. These notices cover the Daneros and the
	Lark and Royal claim areas. Energy Fuels is reviewing plans for additional
	surface drilling in the Daneros Project area.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A surety bond totalling $81,120 has been posted with regulatory
	authorities to secure reclamation at the Daneros Project.

<I>
	Geological Setting
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Major uranium deposits of the east-central Colorado Plateau
	district occur principally in two fluvial sandstone sequences. The older is
	located at or near the base of the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation and the other
	occurs in the Late Jurassic Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. The main
	uranium-bearing unit at the Daneros Project and throughout the White Canyon
	district is the fluvial Shinarump Member, a basal, sandstone-conglomerate
	sequence deposited in a complex stream system which unconformably overlies and
	locally scours into oxidized sedimentary units of the Moenkopi Formation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Shinarump Member consists of predominantly
	trough-crossbedded, coarse-grained sandstone and minor gray, carbonaceous
	mudstone and is interpreted as a valley-fill sequence overlain by deposits of a
	braided stream system. Uranium mineralization appears to be related to
	low-energy depositional environments in that uranium is localized in fluvial
	sandstones that lie beneath organic-rich lacustrine-marsh mudstones and
	carbonaceous delta-front sediments. The reducing environment preserved in these
	facies played an important role in the localization of uranium.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Uranium deposits consist of closely-spaced, lenticular
	mineralized pods which are generally concordant with bedding in paleochannel
	sediments. Single mineralized pods range from a few feet to a few hundred feet
	in length and from less than one to more than 10 feet in thickness. Deposits
	range in size from a few tons to more than 600,000 tons. The Shinarump deposits
	generally have low vanadium content, and are therefore not processed for
	vanadium recovery.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The uranium deposit at the Daneros Project, like nearly all
	others in the White Canyon district, is in the lower part of the Shinarump,
	especially where it has scoured into the Moenkopi. The lithology, facies,
	sedimentary structures, and locations within the channel deposits all were
	important in controlling the migration of fluids and localization of the
	deposits. Coarser-grained rock is more favorable than fine-grained sand or silt
	units. Most of the uranium mineralization is overlying impermeable siltstones of
	the Moenkopi or local siltstone lenses internal of the Shinarump. The lateral
	edges of channels where they are bounded by mudstones are also favorable
	locations for mineralization. Historical production from the White Canyon
	District exceeds 11 million pounds of U

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Canyon mining district has a long history of
	exploration and mining. From 1949&#150;1987 production from the district was
	2,259,822 tons at an average grade of 0.24% U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	for a
	total of 11,069,032 pounds placing itsecond, behind Lisbon Valley,
	for uranium production from the Chinle Formation on the Colorado Plateau.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Exploration for uranium has been going on in the White Canyon
	area since the late 1940s. Prospectors used Geiger counters to investigate
	outcrops of the Shinarump Sandstone. The history of exploration is closely tied
	to the Atomic Energy Commission (
<B>
	&#147;AEC&#148;
</B>
	) buying program, opening and closing of the several processing
	facilities in the region, and the fluctuation of the price of uranium.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The properties in the Daneros Project area remained idle until
	1946. From 1948 until 1951, White Canyon and the nearby Red Canyon and Deer Flat
	areas were subject to intense exploration. The AEC ore procurement program ended
	on December 31, 1970, and during the early 1970s minimal production was recorded
	from the district.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Production from the district increased again by 1974 when the
	demand for uranium increased due to nuclear power generation. Exploration and
	production once again increased in the White Canyon District. In 1974, Utah

	White Canyon district, which included a 100% interest in the Spook-Bullseye
	property and a 60% interest in the Lark-Royal property both located near the
	Daneros Project in Red Canyon.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Between 1975 and 1985, UP&amp;L conducted several phases of
	drilling leading to definition of the Lark, Royal, and Bullseye deposits near
	the modern day Daneros Project. UP&amp;L drilled 595 diamond drill holes with an
	average depth of 510 feet and, following industry standard procedures, logged
	all holes using down-hole geophysical (gamma) probes to identify radioactive
	horizons. Anomalous horizons were sampled and analyzed for uranium.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	UP&amp;L never started mining activities in the White Canyon
	district, due to the collapse of the uranium price by 1982. By 1987 the last
	mines in the White Canyon district closed due to declining economics,
	socio-political factors and competition from lower cost producers. Following
	1987, the properties were idle and little or no exploration activity took place
	in the White Canyon district.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 1993 UP&amp;L dropped its mining claims in the White Canyon
	District. In October 1993, Eugene and Merwin Shumway staked the Daneros claims
	that covered the deposits UP&amp;L had discovered. Eugene and Merwin Shumway
	quitclaimed their claims to Wilene and Mike Shumway, Terry Leach, and James
	Lammert in March, 1994. No exploration or development took place between 1994
	and 2005. From 2005 to 2007, these individuals began acquiring properties with
	known historic mineral deposits in the White Canyon district.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 2007, Utah Commodities Pty, Ltd. who later changed its name
	to White Canyon Uranium Limited (&#147;
<B>
	WCUL
</B>
	&#148;), which operated in the United
	States through its wholly owned subsidiary, UEC, acquired a 100% interest in the
	Daneros claims from those individuals. In December 2008, WCUL purchased 33
	additional claims, known as the Lark-Royal Project, an extension of the Daneros
	Project, from Uranium One.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	WCUL began drilling programs in Bullseye Canyon during 2007.
	The first program drilled 8 holes within the five Daneros claims. A second
	program in 2008 drilled 16 diamond drill holes and 1 rotary drill hole. Finally,
	a third program, also in 2008, drilled 11 diamond drill holes and 9
	rotary drill holes. The success of this drilling provided the basis for mineral
	resource estimates relied upon by WCUL to commence mining activities at the
	Daneros Project.

	The Daneros Project was constructed and uranium bearing
	material was extracted by WCUL, through its subsidiary UEC. WCUL gathered the
	necessary environmental data and submitted applications for approvals to open an
	underground facility at Daneros. A PO was submitted to the BLM and was approved
	in May, 2009, following which UEC commenced active construction at the project,
	including driving a decline into the main deposit at Daneros. The first loads of
	mineralized material from the Daneros Project were delivered to the White Mesa
	Mill in December, 2009, then operated by Denison Mines. In January 2010, Denison
	entered into a toll milling agreement with UEC, which was then a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of WCUL.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 2011, Denison acquired all of the issued and outstanding
	shares of WCUL, including all of the shares of UEC. In June 2012, Energy Fuels
	acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of WCUL as part of its
	acquisition of the U.S. Mining Division from Denison, which included the Daneros Project
	and all of the shares of UEC (which is now named EFR White Canyon Corp.).
	Denison, and then the Company, kept the project in operation using the same
	contractors (until placing it on standby in October 2012 after the Daneros
	Project Technical Report was written. From 2010 through 2012 Denison and the

	Uraninite (pitchblende) is by far the dominant primary uranium
	mineral in the Shinarump deposits. It occurs as distinct grains, fine-grained
	coatings on and pore-fillings between detrital quartz grains, partial
	replacement of feldspar grains, and as replacement in carbonized wood and other
	remains of organic matter. Metallic sulfide minerals are often abundant. Where
	secondary oxidation has occurred, minor amounts of uranyl carbonates, sulfates,
	and phosphates are found. The source of the uranium is not well established.
	Overlying shaley units of the Chinle contain clays derived from volcanic ash
	that is uraniferous. The source area of the arkosic sediments was also a
	uranium-rich province.

	Our properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, but
	outside of the Nichols Ranch Project, include 19,801 acres consisting of
	property 100% owned by the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, Uranerz.
	These properties include: the North Rolling Pin Property, the Reno Creek
	Property, the West North Butte Property, and the Collins Draw, Willow Creek,
	East Nichols, North Nichols, Verna Ann, and Niles Ranch properties.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In general, these ISR projects are located in basins containing
	sandstones of Tertiary age with known uranium mineralization. Limited
	exploration was conducted by Uranerz on each project except for Verna Ann and
	Niles Ranch.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Additional leasing in the Reno Creek Property prompted Uranerz
	to acquire past exploration data for this area, which indicates potential
	uranium mineralization. Additional exploration and environmental base-line work
	will be required before submitting permit applications for the Reno Creek
	Property. The Reno Creek Property consists of three unpatented lode mining
	claims, 18 mineral leases, and three surface use agreements. The project area
	covers approximately 1,332.57 acres. The fee land in the project is covered by
	mineral leases, some of which have annual payments and some of which are paid up
	leases. The mineral leases have primary terms of 10 years and can be held by
	production (as defined in the leases). Some of the mineral leases will expire
	in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The fee surface is covered by three Surface Use
	Agreements which include damage payments paid on an annual basis. Sixteen of the
	mining leases have a two-tier royalty based on the price of

	The Sage Plain Project is a uranium/vanadium property in the
	evaluation stage. It is located in southeast Utah about 15 miles northeast of
	Monticello, Utah in the southwest continuation of the Uravan Mineral Belt. The
	project area includes one historic property, the Calliham Mine, which was
	operated by Atlas Minerals in the 1980s and briefly by Umetco Minerals Corp. in
	the early 1990&#146;s. Calliham ceased production due to low uranium prices. It
	consists of three fee mineral leases covering about 1,670 acres. A description

	the White Mesa Mill. The Company does not consider this claim to have any merit,
	and therefore does not believe it will materially affect our financial position,
	results of operations or cash flows. In January, 2013, the Company filed a

	involve the appointment of an administrative law judge to hear the matter. The
	Company does not consider this action to have any merit. If the petition is
	successful, the likely outcome would be a requirement to modify or replace the
	existing Corrective Action Plan. At this time, the Company does not believe any
	such modification or replacement would materially affect our financial position,
	results of operations or cash flows. However, the scope and costs of remediation

	In April 2014, the Grand Canyon Trust filed a citizen suit in

	Mesa Mill. In October 2014, the plaintiffs were granted leave by the court to
	add further purported violations to their April 2014 suit. The Complaint, as
	amended, alleges that radon from one of the Mill&#146;s tailings impoundments
	exceeded the standard; that the mill is in violation of a requirement that only
	two tailings impoundments may be in operation at any one time; and that certain
	other violations related to the manner of measuring and reporting radon results
	from one of the tailings impoundments occurred in 2013. The Complaint asks the
	court to impose injunctive relief, civil penalties of up to $37,500 per day per
	violation, costs of litigation including attorneys&#146; fees, and other relief. The
	Company believes the issues raised in the Complaint are being addressed through
	the proper regulatory channels and that we are currently in compliance with all
	applicable regulatory requirements relating to those matters. The Company
	intends to defend against all issues raised in the Complaint. The parties are

	(c) directing operations to cease at the Canyon Project and enjoining the USFS
	from allowing any further exploration or mining-related activities at the Canyon
	Project until the USFS fully complies with all applicable laws. In April 2013,
	the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which was denied by
	the District Court in September, 2013. On April 7, 2015, the District Court
	issued its final ruling on the merits in favor of the Defendants and the Company
	and against the Canyon Plaintiffs on all counts. The Canyon Plaintiffs appealed
	the District Court&#146;s ruling on the merits to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
	and filed motions for an injunction pending appeal with the District Court.
	Those motions for an injunction pending appeal were denied by the District Court
	on May 26, 2015. Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed urgent motions for an injunction
	pending appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which were denied on
	June 30, 2015. Briefing on the appeal on the merits is now complete, and the
	parties are waiting for a hearing to be scheduled. If the Canyon Plaintiffs are
	successful on their appeal on the merits, the Company may be required to maintain
	the Canyon Project on standby pending resolution of the matter. Such a required
	prolonged stoppage of shaft sinking and mining activities could have a
	significant impact on our future operations.

	are incorporated into the Equity Incentive Plan. Employees, directors, and

	Equity Incentive Plan. The Board of Directors, or a Committee authorized by the

	stock-based awards to eligible participants. The ability to grant a broad range

	(Canada) and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
	or the Tax Act, to a holder who acquires, as beneficial owner, our Common

	holds the Common Shares as capital property; (ii) deals at arm&#146;s length with,
	and is not affiliated with, us or the underwriters; (iii) is not, and is not
	deemed to be resident in Canada; and (iv) does not use or hold and will not be
	deemed to use or hold, our Common Shares in a business carried on in Canada, or
	a Non-Resident Holder. Generally, our Common Shares will be considered to be
	capital property to a Non-Resident Holder provided the Non-Resident Holder does
	not hold our Common Shares in the course of carrying on a business of trading or
	dealing in securities and has not acquired them in one or more transactions
	considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. Special rules,
	which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a NonResident Holder that
	is an insurer that carries on an insurance business in Canada and elsewhere.
<B>
	Such NonResident Holders should seek advice from their own tax
	advisors
</B>
	.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This summary is based upon the provisions of the Tax Act in

	management&#146;s understanding of the current administrative policies and practices
	of the Canada Revenue Agency, or the CRA, published in writing by it prior to
	the date hereof. This summary assumes the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in
	the form proposed. However, no assurance can be given that the Proposed
	Amendments will be enacted in their current form, or at all. This summary is not
	exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations and,
	except for the Proposed Amendments, does not take into account or anticipate any
	changes in the law or any changes in the CRA&#146;s administrative policies or
	practices, whether by legislative, governmental, or judicial action or decision,

	Disposition of Common Shares
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A Non-Resident Holder will not generally be subject to tax
	under the Tax Act on a disposition of a common share, unless the common share
	constitutes &#147;taxable Canadian property&#148; (as defined in the Tax Act) of the
	Non-Resident Holder at the time of disposition and the Non-Resident Holder is
	not entitled to relief under an applicable income tax treaty or convention.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Provided the common shares are listed on a &#147;designated stock
	exchange&#148;, as defined in the Tax Act (which currently includes the TSX and NYSE
	MKT) at the time of disposition, the common shares will generally not constitute
	taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident Holder at that time, unless at any
	time during the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition the
	following two conditions are satisfied concurrently: (i) (a) the NonResident
	Holder; (b) persons with whom the Non-Resident Holder did not deal at arm&#146;s
	length; (c) partnerships in which the Non-Resident Holder or a person described
	in (b) holds a membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more
	partnerships; or (d) any combination of the persons and partnerships described
	in (a) through (c), owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or
	series of our shares; and (ii) more than 50% of the fair market value of our
	shares was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: real
	or immovable property situated in Canada, &#147;Canadian resource properties&#148;,
	&#147;timber resource properties&#148; (each as defined in the Tax Act), and options in
	respect of, or interests in or for civil law rights in, such properties.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Act,
	the common shares could be deemed to be taxable Canadian property. Even if the
	common shares are taxable Canadian property to a Non-Resident Holder, such
	NonResident Holder may be exempt from tax under the Tax Act on the disposition
	of such common shares by virtue of an applicable income tax treaty or
	convention.
<B>
	A Non-Resident Holder contemplating a disposition of Common

	advisor prior to such disposition.

	Receipt of Dividends

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Dividends received or deemed to be received by a Non-Resident

	the Tax Act. The general rate of withholding tax is 25%, although such rate may
	be reduced under the provisions of an applicable income tax convention between
	Canada and the Non-Resident Holder&#146;s country of residence. For example, under
	the
<I>
	Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (1980)
</I>
	as amended, or the
	Treaty, the rate is generally reduced to 15% where the Non-Resident Holder is a

	benefits of, the Treaty.

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following discussion and analysis should be read in
	conjunction with our financial statements for the three years ended December 31,
	2015, and the related notes thereto. This discussion and analysis contains
	forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.
	Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these
	forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not
	limited to, those set forth under the section heading &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#148;
	and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See section heading &#147;Cautionary Statement
	Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.&#148;

<B>
	Conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 2013, the Company listed its shares on the NYSE MKT, and
	registered its securities under the Exchange Act. This registration subjected
	the Company to ongoing reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. Under the
	multijurisdictional disclosure system, Canadian issuers that meet the definition
	of &#145;foreign private issuer&#146; under the rules of the United States Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the &#147;
<B>
	SEC
</B>
	&#148;) are permitted to use Canadian disclosure
	documents to largely satisfy their reporting requirements with the SEC. As a
	result of the June 2015 acquisition of Uranerz, the Company now has more than
	50% of its outstanding voting securities of record held either directly or
	indirectly by residents of the United States. Accordingly, the Company ceased to
	meet the requirements for &#147;foreign private issuer&#148; status for SEC reporting
	purposes and, as of January 1, 2016, became a domestic issuer.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As a U.S. domestic issuer, the Company is required to file an
	annual report on Form 10-K covering the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company is also, as of
	January 1, 2016, obligated to comply with additional reporting requirements of
	the Exchange Act applicable to domestic issuers, including filing quarterly
	reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and proxy statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	U.S. domestic issuers are required to prepare financial
	statements included in SEC filings in accordance with United States Generally
	Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;US GAAP&#148;) and to report in U.S. dollars.
	Accordingly, the Company&#146;s Annual Report on this Form 10-K contains, for the
	three years ended December 31, 2015 audited annual financial statements which
	have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. All financial statements and
	selected financial data for prior periods presented herein have been converted
	from IFRS into US GAAP.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Prior to June 2012, Energy Fuels was primarily a uranium and
	vanadium exploration, permitting, and evaluation company with no revenue or
	operating properties. In June 2012, Energy Fuels acquired the US Mining Division
	of Denison Mines Corp. and began revenue producing activities from these
	properties. The activities of Energy Fuels, including support staff and
	expenditures, increased dramatically upon completion of the acquisition. All
	activities of the Company prior to the June 18, 2015 acquisition of Uranerz
	concerned the Conventional Uranium Segment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On June 18, 2015, Energy Fuels acquired all of the outstanding
	shares of Uranerz which had, among other properties, an active
<I>
	in situ
</I>
	uranium extraction and recovery facility. These operations acquired from Uranerz
	are included in the consolidated financial statements as of June 18, 2015 and
	represent the Company&#146;s ISR Uranium Segment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While the Company has uranium extraction and recovery
	activities and generates revenue, it is in the Exploration Stage (as defined by
	SEC Industry Guide 7) as it has no Proven or Probable Reserves within the
	meaning of SEC Industry Guide 7. Under US GAAP, for a property that has no
	Proven or Probable Reserves, the Company capitalizes the cost of acquiring the
	property (including mineral properties and rights) and expenses all costs
	related to the property incurred subsequent to the acquisition of such property.
	Acquisition costs of a property are depreciated over its estimated useful life
	for a revenue generating property or expensed if the property is sold or
	abandoned. Acquisition costs are subject to impairment if so indicated.

	With the June 2015 acquisition of Uranerz, which includes the
	Nichols Ranch Project, Energy Fuels has increased its flexibility to adjust its
	recovery of uranium to respond to market conditions and to meet the requirements
	of its sales contracts. As a result, the Company has expanded its ability to
	bring additional uranium extraction and recovery on line within months after a
	decision is made. This allows the Company to efficiently fulfill its existing
	commitments and commit to new spot and term sales that will be sourced from
	uranium recovered from the Company&#146;s facilities. The Company plans to extract
	and/or recover uranium from the following sources in 2016 (each of which is more
	fully described below):

	In response to continued uranium price weakness and market
	uncertainty, the Company expects to continue cash conservation efforts until
	such time that sustained improvement in uranium market conditions is observed.
	In addition, the Company is continuing to manage its activities and assets
	conservatively, maintaining its substantial uranium resource base and its ISR
	and conventional uranium extraction and recovery capabilities, and only
	scheduling recovery at the White Mesa Mill and the Nichols Ranch Project as
	market conditions, availability of mill feed, cash needs, and/or contract
	delivery requirements may warrant.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company expects to recover approximately 950,000 pounds of
	finished U3O8 for the year ending December 31, 2016, as further described below.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company currently has finished goods inventory and uranium
	extraction and recovery capabilities that exceed the commitments contained in
	its existing sales contracts. As a result, both ISR and conventional uranium
	extraction and/or recovery have been, and are expected to continue to be,
	maintained at conservative levels until such time as market conditions improve
	sufficiently and/or the Company requires cash to meet its business needs. This
	allows the Company to maintain its mineral resources for future sales at price
	levels that we expect to be higher than current levels and, accordingly, to be
	able to achieve the benefit of expected future uranium price increases.

	At December 31, 2015, the Nichols Ranch Wellfields had six
	header houses extracting uranium. The Company plans to complete three additional
	header houses by the end of 2016. The Company has completed all monitor wells in
	Production Area #2.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In February 2016, the Company completed construction of the
	elution circuit and began the elution process at the Nichols Ranch Plant.
	Yellowcake slurry from this circuit will be shipped to our White Mesa Mill for
	final yellowcake drying, packaging, and shipment to a conversion facility.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Permitting of the adjacent Jane Dough Property is continuing
	and is expected to be completed in advance of our need to begin wellfield
	construction. Also, the Hank Project is fully permitted to be constructed as a

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign
	basis, whereby uranium recovery is scheduled as mill feed, cash needs, contract
	requirements, and/or market conditions may warrant. Once the processing for 2016
	concludes (expected to be in late 2016), the Company expects to place uranium
	recovery activities at the Mill on standby until additional mill feed becomes
	available. The Mill will dry and package material from the Nichols Ranch Plant
	and continue to receive and stockpile alternate feed materials for future
	milling campaigns. Each future milling campaign will be subject to receipt of
	sufficient mill feed that would allow the Company to operate the Mill on a
	profitable basis and/or recover a portion of its standby costs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company has re-started shaft sinking activities at the
	Canyon Project and has completed the installation of new equipment and
	infrastructure to optimize shaft sinking rates and realize construction cost
	savings. Once the shaft depth approaches the mineralized zone, we plan to
	complete additional exploration drilling to further evaluate the deposit. The
	timing of our plans to extract and process mineralized materials from this
	project will be based on the results of this additional evaluation work, along
	with market conditions, available financing, and sales requirements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company expects to continue to pursue permitting activities
	at certain of its conventional projects, including the Roca Honda Project and
	the Sheep Mountain Project. The Company will also continue to evaluate the
	Bullfrog Property at its Henry Mountains Project. Expenditures for certain of
	these projects have been adjusted to coincide with expected dates of price
	recoveries based on our forecasts.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Finally, the Company plans to continue to maintain, and update
	as necessary, all permits on its standby properties. These properties will
	remain on standby until market conditions improve such that the material can be
	sold at prices that support extraction. The Company also plans to continue to
	evaluate its non-core properties for sale or abandonment in order to reduce
	costs and/or receive value for these properties. The Company is continuing to
	monitor corporate and field overhead to reflect the lower levels of activity.

	In 2017, the Company expects to have existing inventory or

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Beginning in July 2012 market prices for uranium began a
	gradual decline from a spot price of $50.75 at June 30, 2012 to a low of $28.10
	per pound in June 2014. Although prices recovered to $44.00 per pound in
	November 2014, they have fallen back to the current spot price of $28.75 per pound as at March 11, 2016 as
	reported by Trade Tech. The Company, as well as many other uranium producers and
	analysts, had expected uranium prices to have recovered by now. While we
	continue to believe the market will recover, uranium prices have not yet
	improved as expected.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In response to the decline in market prices and the continued
	uncertainty in the expected recovery of prices, Energy Fuels has cut back its
	activities by: (i) placing various properties on standby, which reduces the
	throughput at the White Mesa Mill; (ii) curtailing or reducing certain
	exploration, permitting, and evaluation activities; and (iii) selling or
	abandoning certain non-core properties that we feel are not of value to our
	continuing operations. As a result, the Company&#146;s variable levels of uranium
	recovery activities over time make period-to-period changes not comparable.

	On June 18, 2015, the Company recorded Goodwill of $47.73
	million associated with the acquisition of Uranerz on that date. The Goodwill
	was a result of the value of the equity consideration given up to acquire
	Uranerz, which was in excess of the value of the assets acquired, net of
	obligations assumed and was valued at the closing price on the day of the
	acquisition ($4.16 per share). Since
	the acquisition of Uranerz, uranium prices have fallen about 20%, and
	considerable uncertainty remains as to the timing of a uranium price recovery.
	In addition, the value of our shares and related market capitalization has
	decreased significantly due to a number of factors. As a result, the Company has
	evaluated the acquisition value of the Goodwill at December 31, 2015 and
	determined that the Goodwill should be fully impaired.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Also, in December 2015, as a result of the uranium market
	factors discussed above, the Company made the decision to sell or abandon
	certain non-core mineral resource properties that it felt were not essential to
	its future operations in order to save costs and/or receive value for these
	properties. These properties are currently being marketed for sale. A total of
	$10.99 million of our mineral resource properties were impaired based on our
	review of the properties and their associated carrying values.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the factors
	discussed above, the Company evaluated the carrying value of the property, plant
	and equipment and mineral properties acquired in the purchase of the US Mining
	Division of Denison and determined to recognize an impairment of the carrying
	values of those assets. Additionally, certain other properties owned by the
	Company were offered for sale, at which time such properties were determined to
	be impaired. These impairments totaled $80.07 million.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Future uranium prices are uncertain. In the event prices do not

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For the year ended December 31, 2015, standby costs totaled

	We also intend to complete the acquisition of Meste&#241;a in 2016
	through the issuance of 4.55 million shares and pay advisor fees with shares.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	SEC Industry Guide 7 defines a reserve as &#147;that part of a
	mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at
	the time of the reserve determination&#148;. The classification of a reserve must be
	evidenced by a bankable feasibility study using the latest three-year price
	average. While the Company has established the existence of mineral resources
	and has successfully extracted and recovered saleable uranium from certain of
	these resources, the Company has not established proven or probable reserves, as
	defined under SEC Industry Guide 7, for these operations or any of its uranium
	projects. As a result, the Company is in the Exploration Stage as defined under
	Industry Guide 7. Furthermore, the Company has no plans to establish proven or
	probable reserves for any of its uranium projects.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While in the Exploration Stage, among other things, the Company
	must expense all amounts that would normally be capitalized and subsequently
	depreciated or depleted over the life of the mining operation on properties that
	have proven or probable reserves. Items such as the construction of wellfields
	and related header houses, additions to our recovery facilities and advancement
	of properties will all be expensed in the period incurred. As a result, the
	Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to
	the financial statements of mining companies in the development or production

	The Company is exposed to risks associated with commodity

	potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the market value of
	uranium. Interest rate risk results from our debt and equity instruments that we
	issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. Credit risk arises
	from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business.
	Industry-wide risks can also affect our general ability to finance exploration,
	and development of exploitable resources; such effects are not predictable or
	quantifiable. Market risk is the risk to the Company of adverse financial impact
	due to change in the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments as

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Credit risk relates to cash and cash equivalents, trade, and
	other receivables that arise from the possibility that any counterparty to an
	instrument fails to perform. The Company only transacts with highly-rated
	counterparties and a limit on contingent exposure has been established for any
	counterparty based on that counterparty&#146;s credit rating. The Company&#146;s sales are
	attributable mainly to multinational utilities. As at December 31, 2015, the
	Company&#146;s maximum exposure to credit risk was the carrying value of cash
	and cash equivalents, trade receivables and taxes recoverable.

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
	of Energy Fuels Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the
	related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in
	shareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
	period ended December 31, 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the
	responsibility of Energy Fuels Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to
	express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
	audits.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
	the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
	whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
	includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
	disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
	as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
	audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
	referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
	position of Energy Fuels Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and
	the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
	three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally

	1. THE COMPANY AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Energy Fuels Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the
	Province of Alberta and was continued under the Business Corporations Act
	(Ontario).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Energy Fuels Inc. and its subsidiary companies (collectively
	&#147;the Company&#148; or &#147;EFI&#148;) are engaged in uranium extraction, recovery and sales of
	uranium from mineral properties and the recycling of uranium bearing materials
	generated by third parties. As a part of these activities the Company also
	acquires, explores, evaluates and, if warranted, permits uranium properties. The
	Company&#146;s final uranium product, uranium oxide concentrates
	(&#147;U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	&#148; or &#147;uranium concentrates&#148;), is sold to customers
	for further processing into fuel for nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company is an exploration stage mining company as defined
	by the United States (&#147;US&#148;) Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) Industry
	Guide 7 (the &#147;SEC Industry Guide 7&#148;) as it has not established the existence of
	proven or probable reserves on any of our properties.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company has two operating segments, the conventional
	uranium recovery segment (the &#147;Conventional Uranium Segment&#148;) and the in-situ
	uranium recovery segment (&#147;ISR Uranium Segment&#148;).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	The Conventional Uranium Segment
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Conventional Uranium Segment consists of a standalone
	conventional uranium recovery facility (the &#147;White Mesa Mill&#148;), conventional
	mining projects in the vicinity of the White Mesa Mill located in the Colorado
	Plateau, Henry Mountains, Arizona Strip, and the Roca Honda joint venture (&#147;Roca
	Honda&#148;) in New Mexico, and the Sheep Mountain Project in Wyoming. At December
	31, 2015 the conventional mining projects in the vicinity of the White Mesa Mill
	are on standby, being evaluated for continued mining activities and/or in
	process of being permitted. The White Mesa Mill also processes third party
	uranium bearing mineralized materials from mining and recycling activities.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	The ISR Uranium Segment
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The ISR Uranium Segment consists of a uranium recovery facility
	to recover from operating wellfields of the Nichols Ranch Project located in
	Wyoming. The Nichols Ranch Project also includes the Jane Dough property and the
	Hank Project. Additionally, the segment includes other mineral properties in the
	vicinity on the Nichols Ranch Project. These assets were acquired as part of the
	Company&#146;s 2015 acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (&#147;Uranerz&#148;) (See Note
	4).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	(&#147;US GAAP&#148;) and are presented in thousands of US dollars (&#147;USD&#148;) except per
	share amounts. Certain footnote disclosures have share prices which are
	presented in Canadian dollars (&#147;Cdn$&#148;).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Conversion from IFRS to US GAAP
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 2013 the Company listed its shares on the NYSE MKT, and
	accordingly registered its securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
	as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). This registration subjected the Company to
	ongoing reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. Under the
	multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, Canadian issuers that meet the
	definition of &#145;foreign private issuer&#146; under the rules of the SEC are permitted
	to use Canadian disclosure documents to largely satisfy their reporting
	requirements with the SEC. The Company satisfied the requirements for &#145;foreign
	private issuer&#146; status until June 30, 2015, at which time the acquisition of
	Uranerz Energy Corporation (Note 4) caused the Company to have more than 50% of
	its outstanding voting securities of record held either directly or indirectly
	by residents of the United States.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Since the Company no longer qualifies as a &#145;foreign private
	issuer&#146;, effective January 1, 2016, the Company as a US domestic issuer is
	required to file an annual report on Form 10-K covering Fiscal 2015. The Company
	is also, as of January 1, 2016, required to file ongoing periodic reports under
	the Exchange Act.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Prior to January 1, 2016, the Company prepared its consolidated
	financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
	Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
	(&#147;IASB&#148;). U.S. domestic issuers are required to prepare their financial
	statements that are included in SEC filings in accordance with US GAAP.
	Accordingly, the Company converted its financial statements from IFRS to US GAAP
	for all periods presented.

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Use of Estimates
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company's consolidated financial statements have been
	prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of the Company's
	consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
	related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
	the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use of management
	estimates and assumptions relate to expectations of the future price of uranium
	and estimates of recoverable mineral resources that are the basis for future
	cash flow estimates utilized in assessing fair value for business combinations
	and impairment calculations; the determination of whether an acquisition
	represents a business combination or an asset acquisition; the use of management
	estimates and assumptions related to environmental, reclamation and closure
	obligations; the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments
	including marketable securities and derivative instruments; determination of
	significant influence; and estimates with respect to assumptions regarding
	stock-based compensation expense. The Company bases its estimates on historical
	experience, market studies, reports by qualified persons and on various other
	assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
	results may differ significantly from these estimates.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Basis of consolidation
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
	the Company together with its subsidiaries controlled by the Company. The
	Company also proportionally consolidates its 60% interest in the accounts of its
	unincorporated Roca Honda joint venture. Intercompany transactions, balances and
	unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries are
	eliminated. The functional currency for the majority of the Company&#146;s operations
	is the USD.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Extracting and Recovery Activities while in the
	Exploration stage
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company extracts and/or recovers mineralized uranium from
	mining activities and alternate feed materials resulting in saleable uranium
	concentrates from its White Mesa Mill and its Nichols Ranch Project. While the
	Company has established the existence of mineral resources and extracts and
	processes saleable uranium from these operations, the Company has not
	established proven or probable reserves, as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7,
	for these operations or any of its uranium projects. As a result, the Company is
	in the Exploration stage as defined under SEC Industry Guide 7. Furthermore, the
	Company has no current plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of
	its uranium projects.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While in the Exploration stage, the Company expenses most
	amounts that would normally be capitalized and subsequently depreciated or
	depleted over the life of the mining operation on properties that have proven or
	probable reserves. Items such as the construction of wellfields and related
	header houses, additions to recovery facilities and advancement of properties
	are expensed in the period incurred. As a result, the Company&#146;s consolidated
	financial statements may not be directly comparable to the financial statements
	of mining companies in the development or production stages.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The White Mesa Mill, and certain conventional mining projects
	in the vicinity of the mill, and the Nichols Ranch Project (collectively the
	&#147;Extracting and Recovery Operations&#148;) were acquired in two unrelated business
	combinations. These Extracting and Recovery Operations were recorded at fair
	value on the date of the respective acquisition and included estimated values
	which included valuing these assets utilizing the Company&#146;s estimate of future
	market prices of uranium and expected recoveries of uranium. The values
	determined included estimated cash flows associated with value beyond proven and
	probable reserves to develop, extract and recover the estimated saleable uranium
	concentrates from these operations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The fair value of the Extracting and Recovery Operations
	recorded on the acquisition date is depreciated on a straight line basis over
	the estimated useful life of the components of the operation since the
	Extracting and Recovery Operations do not have proven or probable reserves.
	Accordingly, all expenditures incurred subsequent to the acquisition dates
	relating to the preparation of properties for mineral extraction, expansion of
	or additions to the Extracting and Recovery Operations are expensed as incurred.
	This includes expenditures relating to activities such as the preparing
	properties for mineral extraction, construction of mine wellfields, header
	houses and disposal wells and additions to the recovery facilities are expensed
	as incurred as no proven or probable reserves have been established for these
	uranium projects.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A business combination is defined as an acquisition of assets
	and liabilities that constitute a business. A business consists of inputs,
	including non-current assets, and processes, including operational processes,
	that when applied to those inputs, have the ability to create outputs that
	provide a return to the Company and its shareholders. A business also includes
	those assets and liabilities that do not necessarily have all the inputs and
	processes required to produce outputs, but can be integrated with the inputs and
	processes of the Company to create outputs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition

	Mining assets, which include mineral properties and rights,

	Non-controlling interest in an acquisition may be measured at
	either fair value or at the non-controlling interest&#146;s proportionate share of
	the fair value of the acquiree&#146;s net identifiable assets. The acquisition date

	Impairment of Assets

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for
	impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
	carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Mineral properties are monitored for
	impairment based on factors such as mineral prices, government regulation and
	taxation, the Company's continued right to explore the area, exploration
	reports, assays, technical reports, drill results and its continued plans to
	fund exploration programs on the property.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At each reporting date, the Company reviews its non-operating
	mining assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any
	such indication exists, the asset is tested for impairment. Impairment losses
	are recognized in profit or loss.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For operating mines, recoverability is measured by comparing
	the undiscounted future net cash flows to the net book value. When the net book
	value exceeds future net undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured
	and recorded based on the excess of the net book value over fair value. Fair
	value for operating mines is determined using a combined approach, which uses a
	discounted cash flow model for the existing operations and non-operating
	properties with available cash flow models and a market approach for the fair
	value assessment of non-operating and exploration properties where no cash flow
	model is available. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of
	recoverable mineralized material, expected uranium prices (considering current
	and historical prices, trends and estimates), production levels, operating
	costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine
	plans. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level
	for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of
	future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company's estimates of future
	cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual
	future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual
	future quantities of recoverable minerals, uranium prices, production levels,
	costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

	Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and
	highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
	Because of the short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts
	approximate their fair value. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash
	equivalents and is included in other current or long-term assets.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Mining activities for non-operating assets involve the search

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s asset retirement obligation (&#147;ARO&#148;) relates to
	expected mine, wellfield, plant and mill reclamation and closure activities, as
	well as costs associated with reclamation of exploration drilling. The Company&#146;s
	activities are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations. Estimates
	of future reclamation liabilities for ARO are recognized in the period when such
	liabilities are incurred. These estimates are updated on a periodic basis and
	are subject to changing laws, regulatory requirements, changing technology and
	other factors which will be recognized when appropriate. Liabilities related to
	site restoration include long-term treatment and monitoring costs and
	incorporate total expected costs net of recoveries. Expenditures incurred to
	dismantle facilities, restore and monitor closed resource properties are charged
	against the related AROs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As the Company has no proven or probable reserves, such costs,
	discounted to their present value, are expensed as soon as the obligation to
	incur such costs arises. The fair value of AROs is measured by discounting the
	expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit-adjusted
	risk free rate of interest, while taking into account an inflation rate. The decommissioning liability is accreted to full value
	over time through periodic accretion charges recorded to operations as accretion
	expense. The Company adjusts the carrying amounts of the ARO for changes in
	estimates of the amount or timing of underlying future cash flows. As the
	Company has no proven and probable reserves as set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7
	any adjustments to the carrying amounts are expensed as incurred.

	liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated
	to the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was
	determined. Foreign currency differences are generally recognized in profit or
	loss. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign
	currency are not translated.

	The assets and liabilities of entities whose functional

	are translated into the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the
	reporting period. Exchange differences on foreign currency translations are
	recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). EFI and certain Canadian holding
	companies have a Cdn$ functional currency. The Company&#146;s US operations have a
	U.S. dollar functional currency.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
	for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
	are recorded based on differences between the financial statement carrying
	values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases
	(temporary differences), and losses carried forward. Deferred income tax assets
	and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates which will be in effect
	when the temporary differences are likely to reverse. The effect on deferred
	income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in
	operations in the period in which the change is enacted.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred
	income tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be
	realized. When the Company concludes that all or part of the deferred income tax
	assets are not realizable in the future, the Company makes an adjustment to the
	valuation allowance that is charged to earnings in the period such determination
	is made.

	The Company presents basic and diluted earnings (loss) per

	attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss)
	per share is determined by adjusting the earnings or loss attributable to common
	shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
	the effects of all potential dilutive instruments.

	Fair value accounting utilizes a fair value hierarchy that

	hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
	lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels
	of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in
	active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical,

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Level 3 - Prices or valuation

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
	(&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) guidance related to
	accounting for measurement-period adjustments in a business combination. This
	update simplifies the measurement-period adjustments by requiring that an
	acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during
	the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts
	are determined, and not retrospectively. This update also requires the separate
	presentation on the face of the statement of income, or disclosure in the notes
	to the financial statements, the portion of the amount recorded in
	current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous
	reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been
	recognized as of the acquisition date. The Company is currently evaluating this
	guidance and the impact it will have on the financial statements.

	Inventory

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In July 2015, ASU 2015-11 was issued related to inventory
	which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of
	cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The
	update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after
	December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
	evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the Company's financial
	statements.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Leases
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 which core
	principle is that a lessee should recognize the assets and the liabilities that
	arise from leases, including operating leases. Under the new requirements, a
	lessee will recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make
	lease payments (the lease liability) and the right-of-use asset representing the
	right to the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of
	twelve months or less, the lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy
	election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease
	liabilities. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash
	flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from the
	previous GAAP. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2018, including interim periods within such fiscal year, with early
	adoption permitted. The ASU requires a modified retrospective transition method
	with the option to elect a package of practical expedients. The Company is
	evaluating the effect of this amendment and the impact it will have on the
	Company&#146;s financial statements.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In July 2015, ASU 2015-12 was issued related to defined benefit
	pension plans, defined contribution pension plans, and health and welfare
	benefit plans. This update designates contract value as the only required
	measure for fully benefit-responsive investment contracts, simplifies and makes
	more effective the investment disclosure requirements for employee benefit
	plans, and provides a simplified method for determining the measurement date for
	employee benefit plans. The update is effective in fiscal years, including
	interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is
	permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it
	will have on the Company's financial statements.

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In April 2015, and further amended in August 2015, ASU 2015-03
	was issued related to debt issuance costs. This update simplifies the
	presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be
	presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. The update is
	effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December
	15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact to

	In February 2015, ASU 2015-02 was issued related to
	consolidations. This update makes some targeted changes to current consolidation
	guidance and impacts both the voting and the variable interest consolidation
	models. In particular, the update will change how companies determine whether
	limited partnerships or similar entities are variable interest entities. The update is effective in fiscal years, including
	interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is
	permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on
	the Company's financial statements.

	The amendments require

	require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not
	alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the
	date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The

	4. ACQUISITION OF URANERZ ENERGY CORPORATION
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On June 18, 2015, the Company acquired of 100% of the
	outstanding shares of Uranerz Energy Corporation. Under the terms of the
	acquisition agreement, shareholders of Uranerz received 0.255 common shares of
	the Company for each share of Uranerz common stock held. Each outstanding
	Uranerz option or warrant was converted into an option or warrant (as
	applicable) to acquire common shares of the Company, on the same terms and
	conditions as were applicable to the stock option or warrant (as applicable)
	prior to the acquisition, except that the number of shares subject to the option
	or warrant and the exercise price of the option or warrant were adjusted based
	on the exchange ratio of 0.255, so as to preserve the economic value of such
	options or warrants.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Uranerz, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a
	United States based uranium company focused on in-situ uranium recovery. ISR is
	a uranium extraction process that uses a &#147;leaching solution&#148; to extract uranium
	from underground sandstone-hosted uranium resources and then recover the uranium
	in the form of uranium concentrates. Uranerz controls a land position in the
	central Powder River Basin in Wyoming, where it operates the Nichols Ranch
	Project. The acquisition of Uranerz provides the Company with current ISR
	capabilities and the capability to expand ISR extraction and recovery in the
	future.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method
	in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, with the Company being
	identified as the acquirer. The measurement of the purchase consideration was
	based on the market price of the Company's common stock on June 18, 2015 which
	was $4.16 per share. The total purchase price, including the fair value of the
	options and warrants, amounted to $106.34 million. The total transaction costs
	incurred through December 31, 2015 by the Company was $6.89 million which was
	recorded in
<I>
	Costs directly attributable to acquisitions
</I>
	and are comprised
	of cash costs of $2.96 million and the issuance of 889,436 common shares of the
	Company for a total share value of $3.93 million for advisory fees and to settle
	a portion of required change in control payments to certain employees of
	Uranerz.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company finalized the
	allocation of the purchase price, which resulted in an increase to plant and
	equipment of $6.81 million and decreases in ARO of $0.18 and Goodwill of $6.99
	million, respectively.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company recorded Goodwill of $47.73 million associated with
	the acquisition of Uranerz on June 18, 2015. The Goodwill represents the excess
	of the acquisition date fair value of the purchase consideration, over the fair
	value of the assets acquired, net of obligations assumed, and is ascribed to the
	reporting unit.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Since the acquisition of Uranerz, uranium spot market prices have fallen
	about 20% and the value of the Company&#146;s shares and related market
	capitalization have decreased significantly. As a result, during the Company&#146;s
	annual impairment test for Goodwill performed as of December 31, 2015 the
	Company evaluated the carrying amount of the Goodwill and determined that the
	Goodwill should be fully impaired (refer to note 20 for disclosure of the
	Company&#146;s valuation methodology).

	In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company identified
	indicators of impairment of its mineral properties due to the decline in the
	uranium concentrate spot and long-term prices and deterioration in the Company&#146;s
	expectation of future uranium concentrate prices with respect to the Company's
	mineral properties. An impairment analysis was performed for these properties
	using the assumptions listed in note 20. The Company compared the undiscounted
	cash flows for the mineral properties tested with their carrying amounts. No
	impairment was considered necessary with respect of Roca Honda, Sheep Mountain
	properties and the recently acquired ISR mineral properties, with the exception
	of properties being held for sale or which were abandoned, since the
	undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amounts for the properties. With
	respect of mineral properties identified as held for sale and properties which
	were abandoned, the Company recorded an impairment totaling $10.99
	million.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	With respect of mineral properties identified as held for sale,
	the Company recorded an impairment of $8.22 million. The impaired properties
	included Copper King, Marquez Ranch, Gas Hills, Juniper Ridge and the Nose Rock
	(December 31, 2014 &#150; Copper King and Marquez Ranch). These properties are
	classified in the other category of the conventional segment. The impairment of
	$8.22 million was based of the estimate of its fair value determined using the
	market approach less projected selling costs. Subsequent to December 31, 2015
	Copper King, Marquez Ranch and Nose Rock mineral interests with a carrying
	amount of $1.30 million were sold in separate transactions for gross proceeds
	totaling $1.36 million.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	With respect of properties which were abandoned, the Company
	recorded an impairment of $2.77 million of which $0.47 million related to the
	properties within the ISR segment. Additionally, during the review of the
	mineral properties abandoned, the Company identified $2.30 million of mineral
	properties where annual leases were not renewed and abandoned during the year
	ended December 31, 2014 but had not been impaired in that year. These properties
	have been impaired and included in the impairment of mineral properties for the
	year ended December 31, 2015.

	In the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company identified
	indicators of potential impairment of its plant and equipment and mineral
	properties due to the decline in the uranium concentrate spot and long-term
	prices from April 1, 2014 through July 31, 2014 and a significant deterioration
	in the Company&#146;s expectation of future uranium concentrate prices with respect
	to the Company's White Mesa Mill together with its conventional mining projects
	located in the Colorado Plateau, Henry Mountains and Arizona Strip geographic
	regions representing an asset group (collectively referred to as &#147;WMM asset
	group&#148;). Refer to note 20 for a discussion of the valuation methodologies used.
	Based on the impairment analysis, the Company recorded an impairment loss of
	$75.05 million for the conventional uranium recovery segment, in the quarter
	ended June 30, 2014, with respect to the WMM asset group. No impairment was
	required with respect to the Company&#146;s conventional mining projects of Sheep
	Mountain and Roca Honda located in Wyoming and New Mexico since the undiscounted
	cash flows exceeded the carrying amounts for the properties. The Company also
	reclassified $7.53 million of conventional uranium recovery segment from plant
	and equipment to assets held for sale, tested the carrying value of the assets
	and recorded an impairment of $5.02 million based of the estimate of its fair
	value determined using the market approach less projected selling costs.

	public offering of 22,000 floating-rate convertible unsecured subordinated
	debentures maturing June 30, 2017 (the &#147;Debentures&#148;). The Debentures were
	issued at a price of Cdn$1,000 per Debenture for gross proceeds of $21.55
	million (the &#147;Offering&#148;). The Debentures are convertible into common
	shares at the option of the holder at a conversion price of Cdn$15.00 per
	common share. Interest is paid in cash and in addition, unless an event of
	default has occurred and is continuing, the Company may elect, from time
	to time, subject to applicable regulatory approval, to satisfy its
	obligation to pay interest on the Debentures, on the date it is payable
	under the indenture (i) in cash; (ii) by delivering sufficient common
	shares to the debenture trustee, for sale, to satisfy the interest
	obligations in accordance with the indenture in which event holders of the
	Debentures will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the
	proceeds of the sale of such common shares; or (iii) any combination of

	The Company through its acquisition of Uranerz assumed an
	$18.58 million loan through the Wyoming Industrial Development Revenue
	Bond program (the "Loan"). The Loan has an annual interest rate of 5.75%
	and is repayable over seven years, maturing on October 15, 2020. The Loan
	originated on December 3, 2013 and required the payment of interest only
	for the first year, with the amortization of principal plus interest over
	the remaining six years. The Loan can be repaid earlier than its maturity
	date if the Company so chooses without penalty or premium. The Loan is
	secured by a charge on most of the assets of the Company&#146;s wholly owned
	subsidiary, Uranerz, including mineral properties, the processing
	facility, and equipment as well as an assignment of all of Uranerz&#146;
	rights, title and interest in and to its product sales contracts and other
	agreements. Uranerz is also subject to dividend restrictions. Principal
	and interest are paid on a quarterly basis on the first day of January,
	April, July and October. The current portion of the note is $3.29

	The Company has stock incentive plans for directors, executives
	and eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include employee stock options
	and restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;). The Company issues new shares of common
	stock to satisfy exercises and vesting under all of its stock incentive awards.
	At December 31, 2015, a total of 4,654,005 shares were authorized for stock

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company has established a stock option plan whereby the
	Board of Directors may grant options to employees, directors and consultants to
	purchase common shares of the Company. The exercise price of the options is set
	as the higher of the Company&#146;s closing share price on the day before the grant
	date or the five-day volume weighted average price. Stock options granted under
	the Company&#146;s stock incentive plans generally vest over periods of two years or
	more and are generally exercisable over a period of five years from the grant
	date not to exceed 10 years. The value of each option award is estimated at the
	grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. There were 2.18 million
	options granted in 2015, 0.31 million options granted in 2014 and 0.50 million
	options granted in 2013. At December 31, 2015, there were 2.12 million options
	outstanding (2014: 0.9 million options) with 1.92 million options (2014: 0.77
	million options) exercisable, at a weighted average
	exercise price of $6.54 (2014: $10.05), with a weighted average remaining contractual life of
	4.27 years (2014: 2.75 years).

	The Company grants RSUs to executives and eligible employees.
	Awards are determined as a target percentage of base salary and vest over
	periods of three years. Prior to vesting, holders of restricted stock units do
	not have the right to vote the underlying shares. The restricted stock units are
	subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. Upon vesting, the employee is
	entitled to receive one share of the Company&#146;s common stock for each restricted
	stock unit for no additional payment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s Board of
	Directors approved the issuance of 282,716 RSUs under the Company&#146;s 2015 Omnibus
	Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#147;Compensation Plan&#148;). No RSUs were
	issued in 2014 or 2013.

	In November, 2012, the Company was served with a Plaintiff&#146;s
	Original Petition and Jury Demand in the District Court of Harris County, Texas,
	claiming unspecified damages from the disease and injuries resulting from
	mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos, which the Plaintiff claims was
	contributed by being exposed to asbestos products and dust while working at the White Mesa Mill. The Company do not
	consider this claim to have any merit, and therefore do not believe it will
	materially affect its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
	In January, 2013, the Company filed a Special Appearance challenging
	jurisdiction and certain other procedural matters relating to this claim. No
	other activity involving the Company on this matter has occurred since that
	date.

	In January, 2013, the Ute Mountain Ute tribe filed a Petition
	to Intervene and Request for Agency Action challenging the Corrective Action
	Plan approved by the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality
	(&#147;
<B>
	UDEQ
</B>
	&#148;) relating to nitrate contamination in the shallow aquifer at the
	White Mesa Mill site. This challenge is currently being evaluated, and may
	involve the appointment of an administrative law judge to hear the matter. The
	Company does not consider this action to have any merit. If the petition is
	successful, the likely outcome would be a requirement to modify or replace the
	existing Corrective Action Plan. At this time, the Company does not believe any
	such modification or replacement would materially affect our financial position,
	results of operations or cash flows. However, the scope and costs of remediation
	under a revised or replacement Corrective Action Plan have not yet been
	determined and could be significant.

	In April 2014, the Grand Canyon Trust filed a citizen suit in
	federal district court for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at the White
	Mesa Mill. In October 2014, the plaintiffs were granted leave by the court to
	add further purported violations to their April 2014 suit. The Complaint, as
	amended, alleges that radon from one of the Mill&#146;s tailings impoundments
	exceeded the standard; that the mill is in violation of a requirement that only
	two tailings impoundments may be in operation at any one time; and that certain
	other violations related to the manner of measuring and reporting radon results
	from one of the tailings impoundments occurred in 2013. The Complaint asks the
	court to impose injunctive relief, civil penalties of up to $37,500 per day per
	violation, costs of litigation including attorneys&#146; fees, and other relief. The
	Company believes the issues raised in the Complaint are being addressed through
	the proper regulatory channels and is currently in compliance with all
	applicable regulatory requirements relating to those matters. The Company
	intends to defend against all issues raised in the Complaint.

	In March, 2013, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Grand
	Canyon Trust, the Sierra Club and the Havasupai Tribe (the &#147;
<B>
	Canyon
	Plaintiffs
</B>
	&#148;) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District
	of Arizona (the &#147;
<B>
	District Court
</B>
	&#148;) against the Forest Supervisor for the
	Kaibab National Forest and the United States Forest Service (&#147;USFS&#148;) seeking an
	order (a) declaring that the USFS failed to comply with environmental, mining,
	public land, and historic preservation laws in relation to our Canyon Project,
	(b) setting aside any approvals regarding exploration and mining operations at
	the Canyon Project, and (c) directing operations to cease at the Project and
	enjoining the USFS from allowing any further exploration or mining-related
	activities at the Canyon Project until the USFS fully complies with all
	applicable laws. In April 2013, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary
	Injunction, which was denied by the District Court in September, 2013. On April
	7, 2015, the District Court issued its final ruling on the merits in favor of
	the Defendants and the Company and against the Canyon Plaintiffs on all counts.
	The Canyon Plaintiffs appealed the District Court&#146;s ruling on the merits to the
	Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and filed motions for an injunction pending
	appeal with the District Court. Those motions for an injunction pending appeal
	were denied by the District Court on May 26, 2015. Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed
	urgent motions for an injunction pending appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of
	Appeals, which were denied on June 30, 2015. Briefing on the appeal on the
	merits is now complete, and the parties are waiting for a hearing to be
	scheduled. If the Canyon Plaintiffs are successful on their appeal on the
	merits, the Company may be required to maintain the Canyon Project on standby
	pending resolution of the matter. Such a required prolonged stoppage of shaft
	sinking and mining activities could have a significant impact on our future
	operations. The parties are currently briefing motions for summary judgement

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company Is engaged in uranium extraction, recovery and
	sales of uranium from mineral properties and the recycling of uranium bearing
	materials generated by third parties. As a part of these activities the Company
	also acquires, explores, evaluates and, if warranted, permits uranium
	properties. The Company&#146;s primary mining activities are in the United States.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The reportable segments are those operations whose operating
	results are reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer to make decisions about
	resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance provided
	those operations pass certain quantitative thresholds. Operations whose
	revenues, earnings or losses or assets exceed 10% of the total consolidated
	revenue, earnings or losses or assets are reportable segments. Information about
	assets and liabilities of the segment has not been provided because the information is
	not used to assess performance.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In order to determine reportable operating segments, management
	reviewed various factors, including geographical location and managerial
	structure. It was determined by management that a reportable operating segment
	generally consists of an individual property managed by a single general manager
	and management team. Finance income (expense), other income (expenses) are
	managed on a consolidated basis and are not allocated to operating segments.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Non-mining activities and other operations are reported in
	Corporate and other.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following tables set forth operating results by reportable
	segment for the year ended December 31, 2015: Note the ISR Segment only includes
	activity after its acquisition on June 18, 2015. Prior to the acquisition of
	Uranerz, the Company&#146;s reportable segment was its conventional uranium segment.

	As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on

	(as defined in Rule 13a &#150; 15(e) and Rule 15d &#150; 15(e) under the Exchange Act).
	Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end
	of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company&#146;s
	disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that: (i)
	information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or
	submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
	reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms; and
	(ii) material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under

	its CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions

	It should be noted that while the CEO and CFO believe that the
	Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures provide a reasonable level of
	assurance that they are effective, they do not expect that the Company&#146;s
	disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting
	will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well
	conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
	the objectives of the control system are met.

<B>
	Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
	Reporting
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
	adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
	under the Exchange Act. The Company&#146;s management has employed a framework
	consistent with Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), to evaluate the Company&#146;s internal
	control over financial reporting described below. A company&#146;s internal control
	over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes
	those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
	that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
	dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
	that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
	statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
	receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a
	material effect on the financial statements. It should be noted that a control
	system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can only provide reasonable
	assurance, not absolute assurance, that the objectives of the control system are
	met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
	subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
	conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may
	deteriorate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The senior executive officers, including the Company&#146;s CEO and
	CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, design and operation of the
	Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in
<I>
	Internal Control
	&#150; Integrated Framework
</I>
	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
	of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework. This evaluation included review of
	the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of
	controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on
	this evaluation. As discussed above, the evaluation did not include the acquired
	operations of Uranerz. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that
	the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting, except for those
	related to Uranerz, was effective as of December 31, 2015 and no material
	weaknesses were discovered.

	8.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Executive acknowledges that in

	acknowledges that the Executive&#146;s employment by the Company and all compensation
	and benefits from such employment will be conferred by the Company upon the
	Executive only because and on the condition of the Executive&#146;s willingness to
	commit the Executive&#146;s best efforts and loyalty to the Company, including
	protecting the Company&#146;s confidential information and abiding by the
	non-competition and non-solicitation covenants contained in this Agreement. The
	Executive understands that his obligations set out in Sections 6 and 7 above
	will not unduly restrict or curtail the Executive&#146;s legitimate efforts to earn a
	livelihood following any termination of his employment with the Company. The
	Executive agrees that the restrictions contained in Section 6 above are
	reasonable and valid and all defences to the strict enforcement of these
	restrictions by the Company are waived by the Executive. The Executive further
	acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of the
	provisions contained in Sections 6 or 7 above would cause the Company
	irreparable harm which could not be adequately compensated in damages alone. The
	Executive further acknowledges that it is essential to the effective enforcement
	of this Agreement that, in addition to any other remedies to which the Company
	may be entitled at law or in equity or otherwise, the Company will be entitled
	to seek and obtain, in a summary manner, from any Court having jurisdiction,
	interim, interlocutory, and permanent injunctive relief, specific performance
	and other equitable remedies, without bond or other security being required. In
	addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in
	equity or otherwise, in the event of a breach of any of the covenants or other
	obligations contained in this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to an
	accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, royalties, commissions,
	remuneration or benefits which the Executive directly or indirectly, has
	realized or may realize relating to, arising out of, or in connection with any
	such breach. Should a court of competent jurisdiction declare any of the
	covenants set forth in Sections 6 or 7 unenforceable, the court shall be
	empowered to modify and reform such covenants so as to provide relief reasonably
	necessary to protect the interests of the Company and the Executive and to award
	injunctive relief, or damages, or both, to which the Company may be entitled.

	substantial benefits and compensation. Employee acknowledges that Employee&#146;s
	employment by the Company and all compensation and benefits from such employment

	of Employee&#146;s willingness to commit Employee&#146;s best efforts and loyalty to the
	Company, including protecting the Company&#146;s confidential information and abiding
	by the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants contained in this
	Agreement. Employee understands that his obligations set out in Article V and
	this Article VI will not unduly restrict or curtail Employee&#146;s legitimate
	efforts to earn a livelihood following any termination of his or her employment
	with the Company. Employee agrees that the restrictions contained in Article V
	and this Article VI are reasonable and valid and all defenses to the strict
	enforcement of these restrictions by the Company are waived by Employee.
	Employee further acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by Employee of
	any of the provisions contained in Article V or this Article VI would cause the
	Company irreparable harm which could not be adequately compensated in damages
	alone. Employee further acknowledges that it is essential to the effective
	enforcement of this Agreement that, in addition to any other remedies to which
	the Company may be entitled at law or in equity or otherwise, the Company will
	be entitled to seek and obtain, in a summary manner, from any Court having
	jurisdiction, interim, interlocutory, and permanent injunctive relief, specific
	performance and other equitable remedies, without bond or other security being
	required. In addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled
	at law or in equity or otherwise, in the event of a breach of any of the
	covenants or other obligations contained in this Agreement, the Company will be
	entitled to an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, royalties,
	commissions, remuneration or benefits which Employee directly or indirectly, has
	realized or may realize relating to, arising out of, or in connection with any
	such breach. Should a court of competent jurisdiction declare any of the
	covenants set forth in Article V or this Article VI unenforceable, the court
	shall be empowered to modify and reform such covenants so as to provide relief
	reasonably necessary to protect the interests of the Company and Employee and to
	award injunctive relief, or damages, or both, to which the Company may be
