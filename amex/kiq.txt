	Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the
	&#147;JOBS Act&#148;), Kelso Technologies Inc. is classified as an &#147;Emerging Growth
	Company.&#148; Under the JOBS Act, Emerging Growth Companies are exempt from certain
	reporting requirements, including the auditor attestation requirements of
	Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under this exemption, the company&#146;s
	auditor will not be required to attest to and report on management&#146;s assessment
	of the company&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting. The company is also
	exempt from certain other requirements, including the requirement to adopt
	certain new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards
	would apply to private companies. The company will remain an Emerging Growth
	Company for up to the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth
	anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant
	to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933,
	although it will lose that status earlier if revenues exceed US$1 billion, or if
	the company issues more than US$1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three
	year period, or the company will lose that status on the date that it is deemed
	to be a large accelerated filer.

	Due to our size and the nature of our activities, we will

	risks facing our Company.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our operations and financial performance are subject to the
	normal risks applicable to railroad equipment supply companies and are subject
	to various factors which are beyond our control. Risk areas include that our
	Company&#146;s products involve detailed proprietary and engineering knowledge and
	specific customer adoption criteria, hence factors may exist that could cause
	actual results to be materially different than those anticipated by management.
	These may include that our Company may be unsuccessful in raising any additional
	capital for needs that may arise; our Company may not have sufficient capital to
	develop, produce and deliver new orders; customer orders that are placed may be
	cancelled; products may not perform as well as expected; markets may not develop
	as quickly as anticipated or at all; or that the productive capacity of our
	Company may not be large enough to handle market demand. Should one or more of these risks and uncertainties
	materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, then actual
	results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements.
	These risk factors are described in more detail below.

	The Company&#146;s products involve detailed proprietary and

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The success of the Company will be dependent on the Company&#146;s
	ability to protect and develop our technology. The Company has obtained patents
	for its external constant force spring pressure relief valves (each, an
	&#147;
<B>
	EPRV
</B>
	&#148;) (Patent No. 5,855,225) and a manway securement system trademarked
	the &#147;Kelso Klincher&#174;&#148; (the &#147;
<B>
	KKM
</B>
	&#148;) (Patent No. US 7,104,722 B2); however,
	the Company does not have a patent for its Kelso Tiger Tube&#153; - Eduction
	Technology eduction tube (the &#147;
<B>
	ETS
</B>
	&#148;) technology. The patent for the ETS
	technology expired several years ago, although the Company does hold
	manufacturing, sale and technology rights. The Company has also obtained
	trademarks for its product names, particularly &#147;Kelso Klincher&#174;&#148; (issued on
	January 29, 2013
<B>
</B>
	under number 4,282,652)
<B>
</B>
	and has filed a trademark
	application for its Kelso Tiger Tube. The Company has also filed a patent
	application under a &#147;Non-Publication Request&#148; for its Bottom Outlet Valve
	(&#147;
<B>
	BOV
</B>
	&#148;) design and its Vacuum Relief Valve (&#147;
<B>
	VRV
</B>
	&#148;). A
	&#147;Non-Publication Request&#148; keeps the patent filing private until the patent is
	issued. Patent applications filed under a &#147;Non-Publication Request&#148; only provide
	protection in the U.S. and not internationally. See &#147;Information on our Company
	&#150; History and Development of our Company &#150; Three Year History &#150; 2013&#148; for
	additional information on &#147;Non-Publication Request&#148;. See &#147;Information on our
	Company &#150; Business Overview &#150; Key Products&#148; for additional details regarding
	EPRVs, KKMs and ETS&#146;.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If the Company is unable to secure trademark and patent
	protection for our intellectual property in the future, or that protection is
	inadequate for future products, the business may be materially adversely
	affected. Further, there is no assurance that our railroad equipment products,
	including the Company&#146;s EPRVs, KKMs and ETS&#146; or other aspects of the business do
	not or will not infringe upon patents, copyrights or other intellectual property
	rights held by third parties. Although we are not aware of any such claims, we
	may become subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to
	the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. If
	we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may
	be enjoined from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing
	fees or be forced to develop alternatives. In addition, we may incur substantial
	expenses and diversion of management time in defending against these third-party
	infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement or
	licensing claims against us may result in substantial monetary liabilities,
	which may materially and adversely disrupt our business
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Further, the Association of American Railroads (the
	&#147;
<B>
	AAR
</B>
	&#148;) has specific adoption criteria that must be met before the

	Although the Company had a positive working capital in the

	income and comprehensive income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 of

	Company may require additional funds which may be obtained either by the sale of
	securities or obtaining debt financing. There is no assurance that the Company
	will be successful in obtaining such additional financing; failure to do so
	could result in the inability of the Company to develop new products, meet

	Although the Company is optimistic about its future as a

	is dependent on four major corporations as customers. The sales to these four
	customers (Customer A, B, C and Customer D) exceeded 10% of the Company&#146;s
	revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. During the
	year ended December 31,2015 the Company had $18,910,122 of revenues of which

	B, sales of $3,196,253 were from Customer C abd sales of $1,959,883 were from

	$23,816,809 of revenue of which sales of $14,997,197 were from Customer A and
	sales of $3,180,348 were from Customer B. During the year ended December 31,
	2013, the Company had $13,131,387 of revenue of which sales of $8,782,478 were
	from Customer A and sales of $3,409,289 were from Customer B. Although Customers
	A, B, C, and D have displayed a pattern of consistent timely payment of accounts
	owing, there is no guarantee that sales to these customers will continue at
	current levels or that these customers will continue to satisfy their payment
	obligations to the Company in a timely manner. The Company does not have any
	formal agreements for long term, large-scale purchase orders with these customers and only sells to them
	based on purchase orders received. The Company expects that a limited number of
	customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of its sales for the
	foreseeable future. The loss of any of these customers could have a material
	negative impact upon the Company and its results of operations.

	There is a risk that the Company&#146;s products may not perform as

	However, the amount of the Company&#146;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to
	cover future products claims. In 2015, the Company&#146;s product liability insurance
	premiums were $338,719 for up to $2,000,000 of aggregate product liability

	In the course of development and production of railroad
	equipment products, certain risks, and in particular, destruction of production
	facilities by a natural disaster, acts of terrorism, acts of war or patent
	infringement may occur. It is not always possible to fully insure against such
	risks and the Company may decide not to take out insurance against such risks as
	a result of high premiums or other reasons. Should such liabilities arise, they
	could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in increasing
	costs and a decline in the value of the securities of the Company. Of the above
	listed risks only an act of war is truly uninsurable. The Company maintains
	commercial general liability insurance for claims up to $2,000,000 in aggregate
	and $1,000,000 per incident, as well as product liability insurance for claims
	up to $2,000,000 in aggregate and $1,000,000 per incident. Although the Company
	believes that the insurance policies currently in place adequately insure the
	Company given the size of its customer base and revenues from product sales, there is a risk
	that the Company&#146;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover future
	products claims.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company currently offers approximately 60 products. The key
	products that the Company offers include a series of 47 types of EPRVs for
	pressure management; 4 types of KKMs; 4 types of bottom outlet valves (BOV), 4
	types of vacuum relief valves (VRV) and 1 ETS product that address the technical
	requirements of load and unload operations and the containment of hazardous
	commodities during transport. See &#147;Key Products&#148; below for a description of the
	Company&#146;s key products and &#147;Markets&#148; for the revenue generated from each key
	product. In addition to current product offerings, Kelso Innovative, the

	The Company recruited and appointed a new executive management
	team in April 2010 at which time a commercial business plan was established. In
	accordance with this strategic plan, the new management team has since
	consolidated the Company&#146;s share capital on the basis of one new Common Share
	for seven old Common Shares; accessed new equity development capital;
	established a new production infrastructure whereby the Company believes it has
	a strong supply chain which provides services and technology to produce the
	products necessary to satisfy customer purchase orders and fluctuating demand;
	secured required regulatory approvals; secured product liability insurance;
	implemented educational marketing initiatives; and grown sales and distribution
	of products to North American rail tank car manufacturers and retrofit/repair
	businesses. The Company&#146;s revenues over the last eight quarters were as follows:
	$3,071,130 for the quarter ended December 31,2015,$4,370,567 for the quarter
	ended September 30,2015, $4,596,741 for the quarter ended June 30,2015,

	$5,648,384 for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and $5,480,034 for the quarter
	ended March 31, 2014. The Company&#146;s net income/loss over the last eight quarters
	were as follows: net loss of $2,283,515 for the quarter ended December 31, 2015,
	net loss of $661,263 for the quarter ended September 30,2015, net income of
	$105,083 for the quarter ended June 30,2015, net income of $328,869 for the

	income of $1,223,575 for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The Company also
	believes that the management team has improved the Company&#146;s business reputation
	and gained the confidence of the railroad and investment community by making
	deliveries on time and satisfying payment obligations on time, which was not
	always the case before the Company&#146;s current management came on board.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company believes that it continues to build a quality brand
	in the railroad industry based on its reputation to create, develop, engineer
	and reliably supply technology and product solutions that address the demanding
	technology criteria of our railroad customers. The Company brings new technology
	to the railroad industry which has historically been slow to develop.
	Specifically, the Company designs products that are aimed at reducing the risks
	associated with transport of non-hazardous and HAZMAT commodities in the
	railroad industry, and the Company attempts to solve problems that have been
	persistent in the market for years. For example, the Company&#146;s BOV design is a
	response to numerous industry requests to develop a better bottom outlet valve,
	and the Company believes its BOV design is an improvement on the standard bottom
	outlet valves. Two years ago, the Company asked several key customers about
	their needs. Several of these customers, including Trinity Industries, Inc. and
	Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., asked the Company when
	it was going to design a bottom outlet valve. Due to its AAR committee work, the
	Company also knew that the existing bottom outlet valves had leak problems and
	corrosion issues. When the Company announced its BOV design, several companies
	volunteered to do the service trial. In the past four years, the Company
	believes that it has successfully gained the railroad industry&#146;s confidence,
	approval and their willingness to adopt its products as evidenced by increased
	revenues from sales and by AAR approvals and certifications for the Company&#146;s
	products. There is no guarantee that the Company&#146;s customers who have inquired
	about BOVs or that the companies who have volunteered to do the BOV service
	trials will purchase the Company&#146;s BOV products.

	In March 2013, the Company announced that it entered into a
	joint sales and marketing agreement with Bulk Tank Inc. (&#147;
<B>
	BTI
</B>
	&#148;), a
	trucking industry supplier, whereby BTI and the Company would market each
	other&#146;s products to their respective customer bases. BTI is the number one
	supplier by sales volume and quality for pressure differential trailers in the
	trucking industry. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company agreed to market
	BTI&#146;s products in the rail industry in the United States, Canada and Mexico and
	BTI agreed to pay the Company a fee equivalent to any mark-up charged to its end
	customers on sales brought to BTI by the Company upon payment by such end
	customers, and the parties agreed that all orders for BTI product would be
	placed directly with BTI and that the Company would not take possession of the
	goods at any time. The mark-up payable to the Company is typically 30% of the
	selling price which is determined by BTI. Amounts are payable each quarter that
	the product has shipped. The term of the agreement is for one year ending March
	12, 2014, which term may be automatically renewed for additional one year terms,
	subject to earlier termination. The agreement may be terminated by providing at
	least 30 days&#146; notice prior to the end of the initial or any subsequent term. As
	of the date of this filing, the Company has been paid $11,384 for sales of BTI&#146;s
	products. The Company does not believe that this agreement is material. Also in
	March 2013, the Company reported that it received AAR approval (AAR Approval
	Number 079002) for a new 75 PSI pressure relief valve that has the highest flow
	rating for this pressure rating and mounting size. The new JS75XL fits a 3&#148; tank
	car nozzle with a 6 &#189;&#148; nominal mounting bolt circle and has a flow rating of
	4,099 scfm. It can also be mounted inside the protective housing on new tank
	cars.

	In May 2013, the Company reported that it successfully
	completed independent testing of its KKM. This evaluation was the last stage of
	qualification of the KKM for railroad use and confirmed that the KKM is a
	leading technology product when compared to similar &#147;legacy&#148; technology products
	currently in use in the industry. The Company is ready for commercial production
	of its KKMs, and upon receiving orders will move the KKM into commercial
	production at its production facility in Bonham, Texas.

	existing rail tank cars. The patent application was filed on June 3, 2013 under
	a &#147;Non-Publication Request&#148; which keeps the patent filing private until the
	patent is issued. The final patent is expected to take two or more years to be

	In September 2013, the Company reported that its new JS330 EPRV
	for pressure tank cars had been successfully pressure and flow tested and
	confirmed by an independent AAR approved engineering test facility in Colorado.
	Our JS330 is a derivative of our existing EPRV patent and meets the performance
	specifications and regulatory requirements for pressure tank cars. It is
	designed for demanding applications in the transport of pressurized commodities
	such as propane and anhydrous ammonia. A patent application is in process. Kelso
	has applied to the Association of American Railroads for an application number
	and service trial approval. It is anticipated that the service trial will
	commence in mid 2015 and be completed in two years.

	apprised of all commercial KKM installations in terms of number of units and in
	what service they are being used.

	Also in November 2013, the Company reported that it intends to commence
	construction of its new production facility in Bonham, Texas in December 2013.
	Construction on this new facility began in February, 2014. The new facility will
	be approximately 44,000 square feet and is expected to be completed in June of

	&#148;) design for use on new rail tank cars and retrofits of
	existing rail tank cars that are in Packaging Groups 1 &amp; 2 (US Bureau of
	Explosives designations) which include all tank cars carrying crude oil and
	ethanol as well as other flammable chemicals. In general terms, in an accident
	involving fire, the DPRV is intended to lower its operating pressure rating to a
	level that will keep the valve open in order to evacuate the tank car in less
	than 100 minutes as required by AAR recommendations. The Company believes, based
	on management&#146;s knowledge of current industry standards and other products on
	the market that the DPRV is a significant change compared to currently available
	technology, and that the DPRV will provide economic advantages to the impact of
	the expense of retrofits facing the railroad industry. The patent has been filed
	under a &#147;non-Publication Request&#148; which keeps the patent filing private until
	the patent is issued. This has been done for competitive reasons. The Company
	expects the DPRV to enter the AAR approval process shortly after the prototypes
	are completed, which management expects to be done in May 2014. The final patent

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company is a railroad equipment supplier that produces and
	sells proprietary tank car service equipment used in the safe loading, unloading
	and containment of hazardous materials during transport. Products are
	specifically designed to provide economic and operational advantages while
	reducing the potential effects of human error and environmental harm during the
	transport of hazardous materials.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company currently offers approximately 60 products. The key
	products that the Company offers include a series of 47 types of EPRVs for
	pressure management; 4 types of KKM manway securement systems, 4 types of bottom
	outlet valves (BOV), 4 types of vacuum relief valves (VRV); and 1 ETS product
	that address the technical requirements of load and unload operations and the

	expansion of the Company&#146;s business to grow earnings to levels that maintain
	financial health without further external funding; improve returns on
	investment; allow for the payment of dividends; and allow the corporate value to

	New additions to the M-1002 and Federal Regulations (CFR 49) in

	at Lac M&#233;gantic, Quebec and other incidents in
	several locations in Canada and the US have further driven regulations to
	improve safety all around as evidenced by the new regulations issued by
	Transport Canada and PHMSA in May 2015. These new regulations are the final
	rules covering construction requirements for tank cars carrying flammable
	commodities (DOT 117), timetables for phase&#150;out of tank cars not meeting the new
	rules and management of high-hazard trains. The Company believes that these new
	rules provide opportunity for the company as new cars are built to replace older
	cars and some older cars are retrofitted to meet the new rules. These new rules
	were influenced by the AAR Tank Car Committee who convenes task groups to
	address tank car safety and use. The AAR Tank Car Committee has approximately 44
	active task groups to address safety, environmental/social concerns of which
	Kelso is active on four.

	error; it is standard practice for an FRA field inspector to inspect for loose
	eye-bolts on a manway by climbing on top of a tank car, standing in the center
	of the manway and actually kicking each eye-bolt to see if it is loose; since

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Kelso quarter-turn ball-style BOV is designed to
	substantially improve field performance. Most general service tank cars have a
	quarter turn ball-style BOV with a stainless steel ball used for unloading the
	tank car. The existing deigns are plagued with problems with seal leaks due to
	debris contamination damage, damaged balls due to physical abuse or corrosion,
	leaks at the valve stem and excessive torque to open a valve. When a BOV
	experiences a leak, it must be removed from the tank car for repair. This is a
	costly operation that takes the tank car out of service for at least 45 days.
	The new Kelso ball-style BOV addresses these problems with new technologies:
</P>
<UL STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY">
<LI>
	The ball is made from a high-strength ceramic material that is 10X harder
	than stainless steel which will virtually eliminate damage due to abuse.
<LI>
	The ceramic material is very resistant to chemical attack thus virtually
	eliminating corrosion on the ball.
<LI>
	The valve design includes a ceramic wiper that wipes the ball as it is
	rotated to remove debris contamination thus protecting the valve seals from
	damage.
<LI>
	The valve stem is designed to use a spring-loaded seal that compensated
	for seal wear thus reducing the likelihood of a stem leak.
<LI>
	The wiper action substantially reduces the torque to open and close the
	valve making it easier to operate.

	The Kelso BOV is expected to substantially reduce the risk of a
	leak and offer tank car owners a more cost-effective product. The Kelso BOV is
	currently approved for AAR field service trial. Patent applications for the

<I>
	Kelso Vacuum Relief Valve (VRV)
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Most general service tank cars have a vacuum relief valve
	installed to prevent tank car implosion due to excessive vacuum in the tank car.
	This can be caused by using an evacuation pump to unload the car or temperature
	change on an empty tank car. The current designs use a very weak helical spring
	for actuation. This weak spring can allow the valve to open even during transit
	and suck in debris which contaminates the valve seal causing the leak. This has
	been a very severe problem especially on crude oil tank cars. Customers have
	pressed Kelso to design a VRV to address this problem.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Kelso design uses its constant force spring technology to
	provide a stronger spring to reduce possible leaks. The spring is housed in a
	protected environment to protect it from the environment. The Kelso VRV is
	currently in AAR field service trials. Patent applications for the valve are in
	process.

	The Company operates one 44,000 sq. ft. production facility and
	one 6,000 sq. ft. engineering development facility both in Bonham, Texas. The
	Company is fully qualified and certified to produce products for the railroad
	industry. It has been granted the required certifications for its production
	facilities from the AAR.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Location to supply chains and customers is a critical factor in
	the Company&#146;s production strategy in order to reduce distribution costs of
	inbound components and shipping costs associated with outgoing finished
	products. Bonham, Texas is within approximately 250 miles of the Company&#146;s main
	customers. The Company controls assembly, testing, certification and shipping
	processes for its products. Production output can be scaled upwards when
	required with minimal investment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s policy is that all parts and workforce must be
	sourced in the United States or Canada when possible. The Company utilizes
	assembly production techniques to produce finished products. The Company
	believes that cast and fabricated components of the Company&#146;s products are being
	sourced from expert certified suppliers because AAR regulations require the
	Company to certify that each major supplier meets the Company&#146;s QA requirements
	which are driven by M-1002 and M-1003. This is a matter of record as the Company
	must have an AAR B1 form on file showing the supplier is approved by the
	Company. The Company requires that the suppliers have current equipment and that
	the suppliers&#146; employees have proper training certifications, including
	certifications for welding. Having a current AAR Form B1 for each major supplier
	is an audit item for the Company&#146;s M-1003 certification. Suppliers of major
	metal components must provide mill certificates per AAR M-1003 for the materials
	proving they are sourced from US or Canadian suppliers or other locations
	approved by the Company. The Company believes that by using certified suppliers,
	the Company minimizes expensive capital layouts for manufacturing equipment and
	certified human resource expertise, which in turn reduces the Company&#146;s
	financial risks due to fabrication and casting errors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Cost control and minimization is paramount to the Company&#146;s
	production strategy as is the plant location relative to customers to reduce
	distribution costs. The Company believes it has engaged individuals with
	extensive production expertise with the overall goal of attaining economic,
	effective and efficient assembly operations. The Company&#146;s internal audit
	requirements require that individuals performing critical operations for
	component parts must have demonstrated a minimum of five years&#146; experience with
	similar production procedures.

	The Company&#146;s marketing professionals work directly with users
	of its products and the businesses that build, retrofit and repair railroad and
	trucking rolling stock. There are two key market segments for the Company&#146;s
	products. The largest and most demanding is the rail tank car manufacturers, or
	OEMs, that produce new tank cars. The other is the railroad retrofit and repair
	market. Both market segments continue to be developed by the Company, but
	management has been making decisions about the operating matters of the Company
	based on the OEM market as OEMs constitute the largest portion of the Company&#146;s
	customer base. Management has established key strategic relationships with the
	Federal Railroad Administration of the United States (FRA) and Transport Canada,
	both of which have requested that the Company participate in and present at FRA
	and Transport Canada training seminars throughout North America. The Company is
	a member of the AAR, Chlorine Institute, Canadian Rail Supply, the Canadian
	Association of Railway Suppliers and Railway Supply Institute (RSI) and
	management has established key strategic relationships with other influential
	members of the railroad community including the FRA and Pipeline and Hazardous
	Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). These key strategic relationships have
	resulted in the Company coordinating its actions with FRA, and working
	especially with the FRA to ensure its products meet regulations and provide
	better technology. The Company believes that it is well connected to the Safety
	and HAZMAT sections of the Class I railroads, such as BNSF Railway, Union
	Pacific Railroad, Canadian National Railway, CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway,
	by virtue of the Company meeting with the Safety and HAZMAT security
	representatives for the Class I railroads. The Company has provided valves and
	manways to install on most of their training cars, and the Company joins them on
	customer and first-responder training sessions at their request.

	research, development and engineering initiatives are conducted through Kelso
	Innovative. Kelso Innovative is dedicated to the creation of new patented
	products that better serve the modern challenges of the domestic and
	international markets for the transport of non-hazardous and HAZMAT commodities
	via rail and road. Kelso Innovative works closely with non-hazardous and HAZMAT
	commodities stakeholders designing products that involve detailed proprietary
	and engineering knowledge and specific industry adoption criteria. Many of these
	new products have significant industrial market prospects. They are expected to
	be successfully developed, introduced and adopted commercially over the upcoming

	The Company has three to five suppliers in the United States
	for each component part of its products, and sources parts directly from these
	suppliers based on the suppliers&#146; ability to satisfy the purchase order within
	the specified timeframe. The Company assembles the components at its production
	facilities in Bonham, Texas to develop its finished products which are then
	shipped directly to the Company&#146;s customers. The parts used to assemble the
	Company&#146;s products are generally available from a variety of suppliers at prices
	which are within the Company&#146;s budget for such parts. Most materials used to
	assemble the Company&#146;s products are commodity raw materials such as steel and
	rubber. These materials are subject to price fluctuations which the Company
	believes have historically been modest based on commodity prices for these
	materials. As Company does not have any long term contracts with its suppliers,

	In April 2010 a new management team was brought in to help
	rejuvenate the Company which at that time was in poor financial health and had
	few business opportunities. Revenues have been: Fiscal 2013 $13,131,387, Fiscal
	2014 $23,816,809 and Fiscal 2015 $18,910,122. At the same time the gross profit
	margins have been; 40.4% for Fiscal 2013, 46% for Fiscal 2014 and 27% for Fiscal
	2015. Revenues for Fiscal 2013 and 2014 grew steadily due to the increased
	demand from crude oil suppliers for new tanker cars with which to move their
	product. This demand caused OEM manufacturers to increase their production of
	tank cars. Revenues for Fiscal 2015 decreased due to a significant drop in oil
	prices which in turn lessened demand for crude oil tank cars. Management expects
	that this decrease in demand for more profitable valves for crude oil tank cars
	will continue for the foreseeable future. Our gross profit for Fiscal 2013 and
	Fiscal 2014 increased due to economies of scale and also due to a product mix
	that sees the industry ordering stainless steel EPRV&#146;s in an attempt to reduce
	the corrosive effect of the sulphur content of the crude oil that is being
	transported. The gross profit for Fiscal 2015 declined due in part to a pricing

	administrative costs were $389,285 per month for Fiscal 2014 and have since
	risen to $463,888 (excluding share-based payments) per month for Fiscal 2015.
	These costs have risen due to the general costs associated with an expanding
	business. Management is realigning its business model and believes that these
	costs will reduce over the ensuing year as the overall demand in the sector is
	anticipated to be flat for the upcoming year. There have been no unusual or

	the decreased demand for tank cars attributable to the commodity prices in the

	The financial results for the Reported Periods are indicative
	of an industrial railroad equipment supply company transitioning from a product
	development organization to a profitable business enterprise that distributes
	commercial products from a high production infrastructure that can reliably
	supply to a heavily regulated railroad industry. The growth in revenues,
	corresponding expenses and resulting earnings reflect the Company&#146;s successful
	progress in the execution of its business plan. The steady growth of sales and
	distribution of our products to the larger OEM segment of the rail tank car
	industry began in April 2012. Financial results reflect the costs and
	investments associated with ongoing product development and the expansion of our
	production capacity (including equipment, lease costs, training and qualifying
	human resources) in advance of higher profitable sales levels. The strategic
	plan for commercialization has also required the Company to make considerable
	ongoing investments in production infrastructure; industrial engineering and
	testing; railroad regulatory filings; liability insurance; and new market
	initiatives. The majority of these costs are written off in the period when they
	occur and reflect in the reported profitability of the Company in the period in
	which they were incurred.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company saw rapid growth for Fiscal 2013 and 2014 but
	Fiscal 2015 saw decreased revenues and profits as a result of a decrease in
	demand from the crude oil sector, competitive pricing issues as well as bringing
	on the KKM manway securement system with all the production costing issues that
	are usually associated with a new product. Revenues have grown steadily from
	$13,131,387 in Fiscal 2013 to $23,816,809 in Fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 saw a
	decline in revenues to $18,910,122. The greatest increase in units sold has been
	realized in Fiscal 2014 as the OEM manufacturers have been receiving orders from
	crude oil producers for more hazardous tanker cars to move their product. Fiscal
	2015 saw a marked decline in orders from crude oil producers for our EPRV and
	the Company believes that this decreased demand will continue for Fiscal 2016.
	The Company saw more orders for stainless steel EPRV&#146;s in Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal
	2014. This is evidenced by the gross profit increase to 40.4% for Fiscal 2013
	and 46% in Fiscal 2014. The margin on stainless steel valves is better than the
	margin on the conventional carbon valve. However Fiscal 2015 saw margins shrink
	to 27% as the Company encountered issues with pricing as well as a sector with
	lower demand than prior years due to a slowdown in the oil sector. EPRV&#146;s for
	the crude oil sector yield a greater margin than those valves sold to other
	sectors. Our administrative costs have increased due to the necessity of
	increased marketing to keep our products in the forefront of the industry as
	well as the added costs of running a public company on two exchanges. In
	addition the Company has spent considerably extra funds on the development of
	new products which will expand our product line. For Fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015
	our monthly overhead costs were approximately $240,000, $389,285 and $463,888
	respectively. Our net income or loss is a result of the previous factors. During
	Fiscal 2015 we recorded a write-off of intangible costs of $298,484. In addition
	the Company conducted a tax review to determine the Company&#146;s exposure to US
	tax. For Fiscal 2015 the Company has recorded a net tax expense of $1,104,088.
	This expense pertains mainly to prior years and is net of the taxes that the
	Company has already paid to the Canadian government. The Company is pursuing
	other measures that may result in significant recoveries in the near future. The
	Company showed a profit for Fiscal 2013 ($2,456,636) and Fiscal 2014
	($4,025,781). Fiscal 2015 reported a loss of $2,510,826. Prior to these
	reporting periods the Company had been incurring losses.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Management cautions that the infrastructure of the railroad
	industry poses many challenges to the development and adoption of our products.
	Economic and regulatory uncertainty could have a material effect on our current
	or future business including financial condition and results of operations. The
	Company is still in the early stages of implementing its commercial business
	plan hence there are financial risks inherent in the Company&#146;s business plans.
	This includes a lack of assurance that a profitable market for the Company&#146;s
	industrial products will continue to develop. Other risk factors may include the
	adverse effects of raw material costs; competition; and environmental and
	regulatory issues if government regulations change in the future. See &#147;Risk

	A key cornerstone of the Company&#146;s ability to sustain business
	growth lies in its ability to create new commercial products. The Company&#146;s
	research, development and engineering initiatives are conducted through Kelso
	Innovative. Kelso Innovative is dedicated to the creation of new patented
	products that better serve the modern challenges of the domestic and
	international markets for the transport of non-hazardous and HAZMAT commodities
	via rail and road. Kelso Innovative works closely with stakeholders designing
	products that involve detailed proprietary and engineering knowledge and
	specific industry adoption criteria. Many of these new products have significant
	industrial market prospects. They are expected to be successfully developed,
	introduced and adopted commercially over the upcoming years. See &#147;Business

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 2015 the Company managed its business development strategies
	in the worst rail tank car market since 2008. HAZMAT businesses cut back on
	production which led to lower demand for rail tank cars. There are many reasons
	for this trend which include political climate, regulatory uncertainty, low
	commodity prices and diminishing economic activity. This is expected to continue
	through early 2016.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Affecting our future business outlook is the impact of
	mandatory new regulations for HAZMAT tank cars. On May 1, 2015 Transport Canada
	(TC) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) of the United States put forth
	their much anticipated design specifications for the new DOT- 117 rail tank cars
	to be used in the transportation of flammable liquids by rail. The final rules
	were developed by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration
	(PHMSA) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The new rules establish a minimum threshold for existing
	DOT-111 and DOT-117 rail cars transporting dangerous goods including petroleum
	crude oil and ethanol and other flammable commodities in North America. The
	primary theme of the new regulations is improving the survivability of a tank
	car in an accident and the adoption and use of the best available safety
	technologies (BAST) for the rail transport of hazardous materials.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Originally scheduled for January 2015 the delayed PHMSA
	regulations have proven problematic to the owners of rail tank cars. After much
	analysis the retrofit option for most owners is cost prohibitive and makes no
	financial sense. It appears that there may be a new build boom forming on the
	horizon as the majority of existing DOT-111 tank cars will most likely be
	re-purposed or scrapped in favor of new tank cars. Compliance with the new
	DOT-117 regulations must be completed in early 2018, a situation that should be
	good for the long-term benefit of the Company.

	Pursuant to the policies of the TSX, the Company is required to
	adopt stock option plan prior to granting incentive stock options and,
	accordingly, the Company has adopted a stock option plan (the &#147;Option Plan&#148;).
	The purpose of the Option Plan is to ensure that the Company is able to provide
	an incentive program for directors, officers, employees and persons providing
	services to the Company (the &#147;Optionee&#148;) that provides enough flexibility in the
	structuring of incentive benefits to allow the Company to remain competitive in
	the recruitment and maintenance of key personnel.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The maximum aggregate number of common shares that may be
	reserved for issuance pursuant to the Option Plan shall be a rolling number of
	common shares equal to 10% of the total issued and outstanding common shares of
	the Company from time to time. Any common shares in respect of which previously
	granted options have been exercised shall not be deducted from the number of
	common shares reserved for issuance under the Option Plan and shall again be
	available for grant under the Option Plan. In addition, the aggregate number of
	common shares which may be reserved for issuance pursuant to the Option Plan or
	any other share compensation arrangement (pre-existing or otherwise) to any one
	participant under the Option Plan within a one-year period shall not exceed 5%
	of the common shares (on a non-diluted basis) outstanding at the time of the
	grant. The maximum number of common shares which may be issued to insiders
	within any one year period under the Option Plan or under any other share
	compensation arrangement taken together shall not exceed 10% of the common
	shares outstanding from time to time.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The exercise price of any option granted under the Option Plan
	is to be determined from time to time by the Board but in any event shall be no
	lower than the last closing price of the Company&#146;s shares before the grant of
	options. The Board, or a committee appointed for such purposes, also has the
	authority under the Option Plan to determine other terms and conditions relating
	to the grant of options, including any applicable vesting provisions. Options
	issued to any Optionee providing investor relations services to the Company must
	vest (and not otherwise be exercisable) in stages over a minimum of twelve
	months with no more than one quarter of the options vesting in any three month
	period, and will expire within a maximum of thirty days after the Optionee
	ceases to be employed by the Company.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The term of options granted under the Option Plan shall not
	exceed ten years from the date of grant, and all options granted under the
	Option Plan are not transferable other than by will or the laws of dissent and
	distribution. If an Optionee ceases to be an Oprionee for any reason whatsoever
	other than death or termination for cause, each option held by such Optionee
	will cease to be exercisable the earlier of 90 days following the termination
	date (being the date on which such Optionee ceases to be an Optionee) and the
	original expiry date of such option. If an Optionee dies, the legal
	representative of the Optionee may exercise the Optionee's options within one
	year after the date of the Optionee's death but only up to and including the
	original option expiry date.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If at any time the expiry of the term of an option should be
	determined to occur either during a period in which the trading of common shares
	by the Optionee is restricted under the insider trading policy or other policy
	of the Company or within ten business days following such a period, then the
	expiry date (and the option term) of such option shall be automatically extended
	to the tenth trading day following the date the relevant black-out period or
	other trading restriction imposed by the Company is lifted, terminated or
	removed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Directors and Senior Management are eligible to participate
	in the Option Plan. The Company does not provide any financial assistance to
	participants in order to facilitate the purchase of common shares under the
	Option Plan. The Board can amend the terms of the Option Plan, provided that,
	among other things, no such amendment may be made that would increase the
	maximum aggregate number of common shares available for issuance as options or
	that would affect the terms of any previously granted stock
	option unless the Company receives shareholder approval for such amendment in
	accordance with the policies of the TSX.

	The Company&#146;s patent for the EPRV is in good standing
	until January 29, 2016. The patent abstract describes the EPRV as &#147;a
	pressure relief valve for releasing fluid through a vent in a railway tank
	car, tank trucks and similar vessels. A valve disc is normally biased in a
	closed position by a plurality of constant- force springs of laminated
	steel tapes on drums supported on upright angle brackets symmetrically
	arranged around a valve seat. The pressure at which the valve opens is
	determined by a pre-selection of the number of springs, laminated tapes
	per spring and the restoring force of each tape.&#148; See &#147;Business
	Overview&#148;.

	be and will not be deemed to be a resident of Canada for purposes of the

	(Canada) and the Regulations publicly announced by the Minister of Finance
	(Canada) prior to the date hereof (the &#147;

	This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended

	(Canada) to withholding tax at a

	(Canada) standard 25% withholding tax rate is reduced
	to 15% on dividends paid on shares of a corporation resident in Canada (such as

	reduction of this rate to 5% where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a
	corporation resident in the United States that owns at least 10% of the voting

	a maximum U.S. federal rate of 15%. Distributions in excess of our current and

	to the extent in excess of such tax basis, will be treated as a gain from a sale

	In general, upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of

	U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between
	the amount realized on the sale or other distribution and the U.S. Holder&#146;s
	adjusted tax basis in such shares. Such gain or loss will be U.S. source gain or
	loss and will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.
	Holder&#146;s holding period of the shares exceeds one year. If the U.S. Holder is an
	individual, any capital gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income
	tax at preferential rates if specified minimum holding periods are met. The
	deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A U.S. Holder who pays (or has had withheld from distributions)
	Canadian income tax with respect to the ownership of our common shares may be
	entitled, at the option of the U.S. Holder, to either a deduction or a tax
	credit for such foreign tax paid or withheld. Generally, it will be more
	advantageous to claim a credit because a credit reduces United States federal
	income taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction merely reduces the
	taxpayer&#146;s income subject to tax. This election is made on a year-by-year basis
	and generally applies to all foreign income taxes paid by (or withheld from) the
	U.S. Holder during that year. There are significant and complex limitations
	which apply to the tax credit, among which are an ownership period requirement
	and the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share
	of the U.S. Holder&#146;s United States income tax liability that the U.S. Holder&#146;s
	foreign source income bears to his or its worldwide taxable income. In
	determining the application of this limitation, the various items of income and
	deduction must be classified into foreign and domestic sources. Complex rules
	govern this classification process. There are further limitations on the foreign
	tax credit for certain types of income such as &#147;passive income&#148;, &#147;high
	withholding tax interest&#148;, &#147;financial services income&#148;, &#147;shipping income&#148;, and
	certain other classifications of income.
<B>
	The availability of the foreign tax
	credit and the application of these complex limitations on the tax credit are
	fact specific and holders and prospective holders of our common shares should
	consult their own tax advisors regarding their individual circumstances.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will be unable to
	meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company&#146;s approach to
	managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have
	sufficient liquid funds to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and
	stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to
	the Company&#146;s reputation. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $3,175,292
	(December 31, 2014 - $9,895,463) of cash to settle current liabilities with the
	following due dates: accounts payable of $543,903 (December 31, 2014 -
	$2,412,302); management bonus payable of $Nil (Fiscal 2014-$694,767); taxes
	payable of $2,004,272 (Fiscal 2014-$975,000) and; due to related party balance
	of $2,795 (Fiscal 2014-$15,187). All payables are due within a year.

	Interest Rate Risk
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future
	cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. The
	Company&#146;s cash consists of cash held in bank accounts that earn interest at
	variable rates. Due to the short-term nature of this financial instrument,
	fluctuations in market rates of interest do not have a significant impact on the
	estimated fair value or future cash flows.

	common shares of the Company. The purpose of the shareholder rights plan is to:
	(a) ensure, to the extent possible, that all holders of the Common Shares of the
	Company and the Board have adequate time to consider and evaluate any
	unsolicited bid for the Common Shares; (b) provide the Board with adequate time

	At its annual general and special meeting held on June 5, 2013,

	to the Company having to incur the additional costs of obtaining shareholder
	approval; and (v) allowing for change of the Company&#146;s name by directors
	resolution instead of by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company. In addition
	shareholder&#146;s approved the adoption of advance notice provisions. Advance notice
	provisions provide a framework whereby the Company can fix a deadline for
	submission of director nominations by shareholders prior to any annual or
	special meeting of shareholders and can set forth the information regarding
	director nominees that a shareholder must include in their notice to the Company
	for such notice to be in proper written form.

	Our audit committee pre-approves all services provided by our
	independent auditors. All of the services and fees described under the
	categories of &#147;Audit Fees&#148;, &#147;Audit Related Fees&#148;, &#147;Tax Fees&#148; and &#147;All Other
	Fees&#148; were reviewed and approved by the audit committee before the respective
	services were rendered, and none of such services were approved by the audit
	committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The audit committee has considered the nature and amount of the
	fees billed by Smythe CPA, Chartered Professional Accountants, and believes that
	the provision of the services for activities unrelated to the audit is
	compatible with maintaining the independence of Smythe CPA, Chartered
	Professional Accountants.

	The Company&#146;s common shares are listed on NYSE MKT. Section 110
	of the NYSE MKT Company Guide permits the NYSE MKT to consider the laws, customs
	and practices of foreign issuers, and to grant exemptions from NYSE MKT listing
	criteria based on these considerations. A company seeking relief under these
	provisions is required to provide written certification from independent local
	counsel that the non-complying practice is not prohibited by home country law. A
	description of the significant ways in which the Company&#146;s governance practices
	differ from those followed by domestic companies pursuant to NYSE MKT standards
	is as follows:
<U>
	Shareholder Meeting Quorum Requirement
</U>
	: NYSE MKT
	recommends a quorum of at least 33 1/3%. The Company&#146;s quorum requirement is set
	forth in its articles, which provides that a quorum for the transaction of
	business at a meeting of shareholders is one or more persons, present in person
	or by proxy.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<U>
	Proxy Delivery Requirement
</U>
	: NYSE MKT requires the
	solicitation of proxies and delivery of proxy statements for all shareholder
	meetings, and requires that these proxies be solicited pursuant to a proxy
	statement that conforms to SEC proxy rules. The Company is a &#147;foreign private
	issuer&#148; as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act, and the equity
	securities of the Company are accordingly exempt from the proxy rules set forth
	in Sections 14(a), 14(b), 14(c) and 14(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company
	solicits proxies in accordance with applicable rules and regulations in
	Canada.
