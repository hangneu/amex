	We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the development of biosimilar and therapeutic equivalent products to branded
	therapeutics and other high-value and difficult-to-manufacture proteins. Our lead product candidate is PF582, a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis (ranibizumab). Lucentis, marketed by Genentech, Inc., a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group and
	Novartis AG, for the treatment of patients with retinal diseases, achieved approximately $4.5 billion in global product sales in 2014. For PF582, we are conducting a Phase 1b/2a trial in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet
	AMD, with our collaboration partner, Hospira, Inc., or Hospira, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (collectively with Hospira, &#147;Pfizer&#148;). Pfizer is responsible for manufacturing, clinical studies and commercialization of PF582 globally upon
	successful receipt of marketing approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our next most advanced product candidates are PF530 and PF708. PF530 is a biosimilar candidate
	to Betaseron (Interferon beta-1b) (marketed as Betaferon outside the United States) that is marketed by Bayer AG for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and achieved approximately $0.9 billion in global product sales in 2015. We initiated a pilot
	Phase 1 clinical trial of PF530 in the first quarter of 2015 and enrolled 12 healthy subjects who received an initial dose of either PF530 or the reference product to assess pharmacokinetic (&#147;PK&#148;) and pharmacodynamic (&#147;PD&#148;)
	parameters. After a subsequent wash out period, subjects were crossed over to receive the other product. Based on the analysis of the trial PK and PD parameters, we announced in November 2015 that there were no statistically significant differences
	in PK and PD between the groups administered PF530 versus the reference product. While the study enrolled just 12 subjects and was therefore not powered for further statistical testing, this pilot PK/PD study has provided the necessary PK/PD
	variability information to advance PF530 clinical development. Following our discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we intend to pursue an abbreviated development path for PF530 consisting of a pivotal PK/PD study in healthy
	subjects and an immunogenicity trial in multiple sclerosis patients, pending the agency&#146;s review of additional bioanalytical data. In 2016, we expect to supplement our bioanalytical package and have additional discussions with the FDA to refine
	the study design. We expect to initiate the clinical program in the second half of 2016. PF708 is being developed as a therapeutically equivalent peptide to Forteo (teriparatide), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, for the treatment of
	osteoporosis. Forteo achieved approximately $1.4 billion in global product sales in 2015. PF708 entered into a bioequivalence study at the end of 2015. In addition to our three most advanced product candidates, our pipeline includes four other
	biosimilar candidates as well as vaccines and next generation biologic candidates. To date, none of our product candidates have completed clinical testing, been submitted for regulatory review or received marketing authorization from any regulatory
	agency, and therefore we have not received revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our product candidates are enabled by

	, which we believe confers several important competitive advantages compared to traditional techniques
	for protein production, including the ability to produce complex proteins with higher accuracy and greater degree of protein purity, as well as speed and cost advantages. The development of proteins, such as biosimilars, requires several
	competencies which represent both challenges and barriers to entry. Due to their inherent complexity, proteins require the use of living organisms to efficiently produce them at a large scale. Traditional techniques for protein production employ a
	trial and error approach to production organism, or strain, selection and process optimization, which is inherently inefficient and typically produces suboptimal results. This historically inefficient process provides barriers to create or replicate
	complex proteins, adds significant time to market and results in the high cost of goods typical of biologic therapeutics. Together, these limitations pose significant hurdles for companies interested in entering the market with biosimilar and
	therapeutic equivalents to branded products. Our platform utilizes a proprietary high throughput robotically-enabled parallel approach, which allows the construction and testing of thousands of unique protein production variables in parallel,

	The 2014 global biologics market represented over $234&nbsp;billion in product sales
	according to BCC Research, with virtually the entire market comprised of branded products. We believe the emerging biosimilar market will be significant due to the large number of blockbuster products expected to lose patent protection in the next
	several years, abbreviated regulatory pathways for the approval of biosimilars and a mandate for lower drug costs by governments and private payers. A biosimilar is a biologic product that has been demonstrated to be highly similar to a biologic
	product that is already approved, referred to as a reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and where there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the biosimilar in
	terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. By 2020, 11&nbsp;biologic products representing approximately $71&nbsp;billion of aggregate 2014 product sales are expected to become available to biosimilars globally according to IMS Health.
	The market opportunities for our three most advanced product candidates are substantial. Lucentis achieved approximately $4.5 billion in global product sales in 2014. By the second quarter of 2018, markets with 2014 Lucentis sales of approximately
	$600&nbsp;million are expected to lose patent protection, and become available for biosimilars. Additionally, by the second quarter of 2020, markets with an additional $2.2&nbsp;billion in 2014 Lucentis sales are expected to lose patent protection
	and become available for biosimilars, and after January 2022 markets with an additional $1.6&nbsp;billion in 2014 sales are expected to also lose patent protection. Approximately $50 million in 2014 Lucentis sales come from markets for which
	accurate patent expiration dates are not available. Betaseron achieved approximately $0.9 billion in product sales in 2015. Interferon beta-1b product sales in markets where no intellectual property barriers exist totaled in excess of
	$34&nbsp;million in 2014 with other territories representing the balance of product sales expected to become available between 2017 and 2021. Forteo achieved product sales of approximately $1.4 billion in 2015. Almost half of these product sales
	came from the US alone, followed by Japan. Forteo is expected to lose patent protection in the US and Japan in 2019.

	independently as a wholly owned product candidate. We have conducted extensive bioanalytical studies, and based on these results we conducted a Phase 1 pilot trial in the first half of 2015 in Australia. The study enrolled 12 subjects who received
	an initial dose of either PF530 or reference product (Betaferon) to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. After a subsequent wash out period, subjects were crossed over to receive the other product. There were

	&nbsp;We have conducted extensive analytical studies that we believe have established analytical biosimilarity
	between PF530 and Betaseron. We completed a pilot Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2015 in Australia. The study enrolled 12 subjects who received an initial dose of either PF530 or reference product (Betaferon) to assess the safety,
	pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. After a subsequent wash out period, subjects were crossed over to receive the other product. There were no clinically significant differences in safety or tolerability between PF530 and the
	reference product. There were also no statistically significant differences in PK and PD parameters between the groups administered PF530 versus the reference product. Based on our analytical and biological data package, the FDA granted us a
	Biosimilar Biological Product Development Type 2 Meeting, which was held in August 2015. Following our discussions with the FDA, we intend to pursue an abbreviated development path for PF530, consisting of a PK/PD study in healthy subjects and an
	immunogenicity trial in multiple sclerosis patients, pending the agency&#146;s review of additional bioanalytical data. We expect to supplement our bioanalytical package in additional discussions and refine the clinical study designs with the FDA in
	2016. We anticipate clinical trial start in the second half of 2016.

	We believe the emerging biosimilar market will be substantial due to the large number of blockbuster biologic products that are expected to
	lose patent protection in the coming years, the abbreviated global biosimilar regulatory pathways and an increasing mandate for lower drug costs by governments and private payors. According to BCC Research, the 2014 global biologics market
	represented over $234 billion in product sales, with virtually the entire market comprised of branded products. Also, it has been reported that the global biosimilars market is expected to reach $6.2 billion by 2020 from $2.3 billion in 2015, at a
	compound annual growth rate of 22.1% from 2015 to 2020. We expect the biologics market to shift toward biosimilars over the coming years, much like generic small molecule drugs which now account for an estimated 88% of the dispensed prescription
	small molecule drug market in the United States. Currently, few biologics are off-patent; however, in 2015, approximately $24&nbsp;billion of aggregate estimated product sales from 2013 lost patent protection worldwide. This number will increase
	every year as several large market biologic products are expected to lose patent protection. By 2020, IMS Health estimates that approximately $71&nbsp;billion of aggregate 2014 product sales are expected to become available to biosimilars in the EU
	and US, representing 11 products where intellectual property rights are expected to expire.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Biosimilars have been approved and marketed in several large markets, including the United States, European Union, Russia, Japan,
	Canada, India, China and Brazil. The biosimilar market is most mature in the European Union, where the regulatory pathway has been defined since 2005. Many countries in the region look to biosimilars as an opportunity for cost savings, resulting in
	the higher growth rate of the biosimilar market compared to the branded biologics market. In addition, the use of biosimilars has expanded access in several countries, where policy makers and payors are driving use of these products relative to the
	branded products. While the specific nature of competition, pricing and adoption is different from country to country, there has been a trend towards adoption of biosimilars across Europe. For example, in the United Kingdom, 83% of the total
	granulocyte colony stimulating factor, or G-CSF, market, is now biosimilar and has resulted in significant increases in patient access. More broadly, the European Union average biosimilar volume penetration of G-CSF has reached 71%. Similarly,
	Germany has seen a significant increase in adoption of erythropoietin (EPO). Payors have instituted biosimilar quotas, endorsed biosimilars with physician education, and conducted seminars as well as implemented utilization review of physician work
	to be consistent with the objectives of the health care system; as a result, biosimilar EPO has over 50% market share in the German EPO market. Efforts in Hungary have shown similar results, where biosimilar G-CSF and EPO represent over 90% of
	market share; Denmark payors, considering a number of factors, have awarded tenders to the biosimilar somatotropin, resulting in an over 50% market share by volume. For somatotropin, EPO and filgrastim, discounts on biosimilars compared to the
	reference products ranged between 7% and 28% in European Union member states in 2014, and, according to IMS Health, biosimilars of these products represented approximately 23% to 81% of the volume in the largest five European Union member states in
	2014. Finally, governments such as Norway are sponsoring clinical studies to drive use of biosimilar infliximab, and in France the legislature passed Article 47 of the Social Security Budget, allowing pharmacists to substitute biosimilar products
	for branded products if the prescription is for a na&iuml;ve patient and there is no &#147;do not substitute&#148; marking by the physician. These data show significant government and payor support of the biosimilar market within Europe.

	The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, was enacted in 2010, creating an abbreviated approval pathway for
	biosimilar products, referred to as the &#147;351(k) pathway&#148;. We believe the agency&#146;s guidance to date provides the necessary clarity regarding approval requirements under the 351(k) pathway to permit the development of our biosimilar
	product candidates and the ultimate submission of applications for marketing approval for these product candidates. A biosimilar application must contain information demonstrating: (1)&nbsp;biosimilarity to the reference product through data derived
	from analytical studies, animal studies (including an assessment of toxicity), and clinical studies (including an assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics), unless the FDA determines that such data are unnecessary,
	(2)&nbsp;sameness of strength, dosage form, and route of administration to the reference product, as well sameness of mechanism(s) of action (to the extent known), (3)&nbsp;approval of the reference product for the condition(s) of use prescribed,

	medicine. Unless the FDA waives the requirement, clinical studies must be sufficient to show the safety, purity and potency of the proposed product for one or more &#147;appropriate&#148; conditions of use for which licensure is sought and for which

	The biosimilar regulatory pathway in the European Union was established in 2005, and the European Union was the first jurisdiction to implement
	a formal regulatory pathway for biosimilars. Requirements for demonstrating biosimilarity between two biologic medicines were outlined by the EMA and CHMP in the Guideline on Similar Biological Products. Under these requirements, biosimilarity is
	demonstrated through comprehensive similarity studies covering quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy. Since then, the EMA has published two further overarching guidelines (the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing
	biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance&#151;quality issues and the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues) as well as various
	product specific guidelines (such as recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone, interferon beta, recombinant interferon alpha, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant erythropoietins, and recombinant human insulin). These guidelines are revised and
	updated regularly. The first biosimilar product, Omnitrope

	additional indication is of significant clinical benefit). In addition, the United States allows for the designation of a product as &#147;interchangeable&#148; with a reference product, meaning that the biosimilar may be substituted by a pharmacist
	for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product, unless the prescription states no substitution. The first product determined to be interchangeable with a particular reference

	Protein production is a fundamental activity necessary for biological drug development and manufacturing. The most common method of
	manufacturing therapeutic proteins involves the use of engineered microorganisms. Proteins produced using these organisms are referred to as recombinant proteins. Recombinant proteins are produced by inserting DNA, or a gene, that codes for the
	protein, into a cell which then acts as a protein production factory. Typically this is accomplished by inserting DNA into an expression vector, which contains genetic control elements that can be used to turn the gene on and off.

	Successful protein production can be impacted by alterations in the production cell functions such as the protein folding apparatus or the
	presence or absence of enzymes that can degrade the recombinant protein. Determining which of these components, or variants, will improve production of any particular protein cannot be determined from the amino acid sequence of the protein being
	produced; therefore it is advantageous to evaluate a very large number of variants. Traditional techniques for protein production employ a trial and error approach to strain selection which is inherently inefficient and typically produces suboptimal
	results in terms of quality, speed and scalability. The inefficiency of traditional techniques adds significant time to market and is a barrier to creating or replicating complex proteins. The result is a high cost of developing and manufacturing
	biologic therapeutics. Together these limitations pose significant hurdles for companies interested in entering the market with biosimilar products.

	engineered genetic elements including promoters, ribosome binding sites and secretion leaders. Determining which of these variants will improve production of any particular protein cannot be determined from the amino acid sequence of the protein of
	interest. As a result, we employ the automated high throughput screening of a large library of the strain variants in order to select the strain that produces the protein of interest at optimal purity, yield and potency.

	Lucentis achieved approximately $4.5 billion in global product sales in 2014. By the second quarter of 2018, markets with 2014 Lucentis sales
	of approximately $600 million are expected to lose patent protection, and become available for biosimilars. Additionally, by the second quarter of 2020, markets with an additional $2.2&nbsp;billion in 2014 Lucentis sales are expected to lose patent
	protection and become available for biosimilars, and after January 2022 markets with an additional $1.6 billion in 2014 sales are also expected to lose patent protection. Approximately $50 million in 2014 sales come from markets for which accurate
	patent expiration dates are not available. Given the characteristics of the patient populations for each of its three approved indications, we believe ranibizumab has attractive long-term growth prospects. In addition, we believe, the market is
	underpenetrated for the approved indications allowing future growth opportunities particularly for lower cost biosimilars.

	Multiple sclerosis affects more than an estimated 2.3&nbsp;million people worldwide and is increasing in prevalence and incidence. The global
	multiple sclerosis market is expected to grow from $14.4&nbsp;billion in product sales in 2012 to an estimated $21&nbsp;billion by 2022. Interferon beta products are the standard of care for first line treatment options in the management of patients
	with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). Betaseron sales were approximately $0.9 billion in 2015, according to IMS Health data.

	We have analyzed multiple lots of Betaseron sourced from the United States, which has allowed us to compare PF530 to the reference product
	which we believe establishes analytical similarity between PF530 and Betaseron. Consistent with established EMA guidance for Interferon beta-1b biosimilar development candidates, based on our extensive
<I>

	bioassays and quality
	assessment, we have not conducted, and do not plan to conduct, preclinical animal studies. We believe that we have developed a manufacturing process that will allow us to produce PF530 for both clinical and commercial purposes.

	We completed a pilot Phase 1 trial in the first half of 2015 in Australia. The study enrolled 12 subjects who received an initial dose of
	either PF530 or reference product to assess the safety, PK and PD parameters. After a subsequent wash out period, subjects were crossed over to receive the other product. There were no clinically significant differences in safety or tolerability
	between PF530 and the reference product. There were also no statistically significant differences in PK and PD parameters between the groups administered PF530 versus the reference product. Following our August 2015 meeting with the FDA, we intend
	to pursue an abbreviated development path for PF530, consisting of a PK/PD study in healthy subjects and an immunogenicity trial in multiple sclerosis patients, pending the agency&#146;s review of additional bioanalytical data. We expect to
	supplement our bioanalytical package in further discussions with the FDA in 2016, and we anticipate clinical trial start in the second half of 2016.

	PF708 is a peptide product candidate that is being developed as a therapeutic equivalent to the reference listed drug Forteo, an injectable
	prescription medicine marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of osteoporosis patients at high risk of fractures. Teriparatide is a shortened version of the naturally occurring parathyroid hormone (amino acids 1-34) that promotes bone growth. To
	date, we have demonstrated production of teriparatide in quantities that we believe predict a competitive cost of goods. We initiated cGMP manufacturing in 2015. Despite Forteo&#146;s status as a biologic peptide currently manufactured in
<I>
	E.
	coli
</I>
	, due to its size (less than or equal to 40&nbsp;amino acids), it is considered a small molecule. As a result, we are developing PF708 pursuant to the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	global osteoporosis market represents a significant opportunity, with product sales that are estimated to grow to approximately $5.2&nbsp;billion in the United States, Japan and the five major European Markets in 2021. Treatment with teriparatide is
	the only treatment approach that promotes bone growth currently available for the treatment of osteoporosis. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), it is estimated that approximately 44&nbsp;million Americans either have osteoporosis
	or are at increased risk due to low bone mass (osteopenia). Forteo (marketed as Forsteo in Europe), is the only product currently approved that builds bone primarily by increasing the activity of osteoblasts (cells that deposit bone). Worldwide
	sales of Forteo were approximately $1.4 billion in 2015, according to Eli Lilly.

	results to date, we have not conducted preclinical in vivo studies for safety or efficacy purposes prior to initiating clinical investigation. We have also completed an initial assessment of the PF708 and Forteo injection pens, and we believe that
	the two injection devices are functionally equivalent. We commenced a pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study in the United States in the second half of 2015 to support the potential licensure of PF708 under the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) regulatory

	In
	October&nbsp;2001, letters contaminated with anthrax spores were delivered to government officials and members of the media in the United States. As a result of these attacks, 22 people became infected with anthrax and five people died. In response
	to this and other terrorist attacks around the world, the biodefense market has grown dramatically. Since 2005, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has been securing medical countermeasures for the Strategic National
	Stockpile. From September&nbsp;30, 2011 through December&nbsp;31, 2013, HHS has purchased approximately 18&nbsp;million doses of the anthrax vaccine, BioThrax. Current government procurement contracts for BioThrax are approximately $250 million
	annually with pricing of approximately $27 per dose. In addition to HHS purchases, the federal government spends billions of dollars in biodefense through NIAID and Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. In 2013, the Pandemic and
	All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act, or PAHPRA, which was originally passed in 2006 to improve the United States&#146; public health and medical preparedness and response capabilities for emergencies, authorized $2.8 billion for the
	procurement of countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks. If successful with clinical development, we intend to enter into a procurement relationship with the US federal government to supply a next generation
	recombinant protective antigen (rPA) based anthrax vaccine to the Strategic National Stockpile.

	In July&nbsp;2010, we entered into a contract with BARDA, a division of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in
	the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to develop a production strain and process for the production of bulk recombinant Protective Antigen, or rPA, from anthrax. Under the contract, we agreed to provide protein production and process
	development services to BARDA. The contract was amended several times and BARDA exercised options to extend the term of the contract. In December 2014, we filed the investigational new drug, or IND, application for Px563L. BARDA extended the

	development of Px563L, which is a mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine. The contract consists of a 30 month base period with total funding up to $15.9 million that will fund activities related to cGMP manufacturing of drug product
	and a Phase 1a clinical study. In addition to the base period, there are eight option periods, with potential additional funding of up to $127.6 million that will fund activities including completion of a Phase 1b clinical study, a Phase 2 clinical
	study and non-clinical efficacy studies, as well as manufacturing technology transfer and optimization, process and analytical method validation and consistency lot manufacture. Pfenex believes the successful completion of the activities under this
	contract could lead to a procurement contract for supply of Px563L to the Strategic National Stockpile. Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, $2.3&nbsp;million had been recorded as revenue under this contract.

	Similar biological medicinal product applications of medicinal products authorized via the Centralized Procedure have automatic access to the

	A similar biological medicinal product, also known as a biosimilar, is a product that is similar to a biological medicine that has already
	been authorized, the so-called &#147;reference medicinal product.&#148; The active substance of a similar biological medicinal product is a known biological active substance and similar to the one of the reference medicinal product. A similar
	biological medicinal product and its reference medicinal product are expected to have the same safety and efficacy profile and are generally used to treat the same conditions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The similar nature of a biosimilar and a reference product is demonstrated by comprehensive comparability studies covering quality, biological
	activity, safety and efficacy. The dosage and route of administration should be the same while deviations in formulation or inactive substances require justification or further studies. Intended changes to improve efficacy are not compatible with a
	biosimilarity approach. The minimum expectation of data supplied with the application will include pharmaceutical, chemical, and biological preclinical data, as well as bioequivalence and bioavailability (bodily distribution and concentration)
	clinical data. The type and amount of additional information, such as toxicological and other preclinical and clinical data, is determined on a case-by-case basis. Unlike in the United States, the directives and guidelines governing the EEA do not
	explicitly provide for the designation of interchangeability of similar biological medicinal products, nor does the EMA submit an opinion on whether a biosimilar can be used interchangeably with its reference product.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	EMA guidelines suggest that clinical trials comparing a biosimilar candidate to a reference medicinal product be designed such that they will
	demonstrate not only similar efficacy but also similar clinical outcome with respect to safety. Clinical trials designed to establish the expectation of equivalent clinical outcomes for any one patient require a sufficiently large number of patients
	in the study such that certain statistical measures are satisfied. As such, equivalence trials are usually more expensive and longer in duration than non-inferiority trials that may be employed in other medicinal product categories. The EMA
	recommends engaging in discussions with regulatory authorities if the use of a non-inferiority design is being considered. If a reference product is approved for more than one therapeutic indication, the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar has to
	be justified or, if necessary, demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications. This may include a review of clinical experience and available literature data, or the execution of further non-clinical or appropriate clinical studies.

	The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain approval to market a new

	demonstrated in humans, may follow the Biologics License Application, or BLA, route as defined by section 351(a). However, a proposed biologic whose active ingredient(s) and certain other properties are highly similar (biosimilar) to those of a
	previously approved biologic may follow an abbreviated licensure pathway as defined by section 351(k) of the PHSA. The FDA, under the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, reviews and ultimately approves applications for

	synthesis and composed of fewer than 100 amino acids, as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, rather than as biologics under the PHSA, unless the polymer otherwise meets the statutory
	definition of a biological product. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA. The results of preclinical studies and clinical
	trials, along with information regarding the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, and FDA review and approval of
	the NDA is necessary prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. However, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic
	copy of an approved branded product. Additionally, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may, under Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, file an NDA that relies on studies not conducted by the applicant, or for which the applicant has not obtained a right

	The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain
	that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on
	the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product;
	chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become
	effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve
	any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence.

	Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators
	in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols
	detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical protocol and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as
	part of the IND, and an IRB at each site where the study is conducted must also approve the study. The IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study
	results to public registries. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three or four sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined.

	Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that
	the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB, or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research
	subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee.
	This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or

	Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements,
	detailed information regarding the investigational product is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from
	pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other
	things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. Under federal law, the
	submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may
	be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

	Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA&#146;s goal is to review the application
	within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is
	often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed,
	packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety, purity and potency. Similarly, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use,
	and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s quality and purity.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will
	not approve the application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally,
	before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, clinical data, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable,
	it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy
	the regulatory criteria for approval.

	The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain
	why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be
	approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and
	each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we and our partners may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could
	delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval
	letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is
	complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or trials, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related
	to clinical trials, preclinical trials or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also approve the BLA or NDA with a
	Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#147;REMS&#148;) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and
	other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical
	trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. New government requirements, including those resulting from new
	legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#146;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.

	approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products
	are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the
	manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose
	reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain
	compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

	The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends
	that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and
	effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in
	active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and
	preserve the biological product&#146;s safety, purity and potency.

	The submission of an application via the 351(k) pathway does not
	guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other
	reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in
	which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product under section 351(a) of the PHSA.

	The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the

	application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application under the 351(k) pathway for four years from the date of first licensure of the
	reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an &#147;orphan drug&#148;) may be entitled to seven years of

	The BPCIA includes a detailed framework for addressing potential patent disputes between biosimilar product and reference product sponsors.
	Within 20 days after being notified that FDA has accepted its application for review, a 351(k) applicant must provide a copy of its application, along with any other information that describes the manufacturing processes for the biosimilar product,
	to the reference product sponsor&#146;s in-house counsel, the reference product sponsor&#146;s outside counsel, and/or a representative of the owner of a patent exclusively licensed to the reference product sponsor with respect to the reference
	product who has retained a right to assert the patent or participate in litigation. The copy of the application and any other information provided are considered &#147;confidential information&#148; under the PHSA, and recipients are generally
	prohibited from disclosing anything contained therein and from using the information for any purposes other than to determine whether a patent infringement claim may reasonably be asserted. The reference product sponsor then has sixty days to
	provide the applicant with an initial list of patents that could reasonably be asserted. The reference product sponsor may also choose to designate patents that it would be willing to license to the applicant.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Once the applicant has received the statement of the basis for the reference product sponsor&#146;s opinion, the parties have fifteen days to
	engage in good faith negotiations to agree on which if any of the patents will be the subject of an infringement action. The PHSA contemplates that the parties may not reach an agreement within this timeframe, in which case additional patent list
	exchange procedures are triggered. The applicant must first notify the reference product sponsor of the number of patents that it believes should be the subject of an infringement action. Subsequently, within five days of this notification and on a
	date agreed upon by the parties, the parties must simultaneously exchange lists of the patents that each believes should be the subject of an infringement action. The reference product sponsor may not list a greater number of patents than the number
	listed by the applicant, though if the applicant lists no patents the reference product sponsor may still list just one. Under this provision, the biosimilar applicant thus controls the number of patents that will be the subject of the infringement
	action.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Following this last list exchange, the reference product sponsor has thirty days to bring an infringement action for each patent
	on both lists. Alternatively, if the parties successfully negotiate an agreement regarding the patents that will form the basis for an infringement action, the reference product sponsor has thirty days after such agreement to bring an infringement
	action for each of the negotiated patents. Within thirty days of being served with a complaint in the infringement action, the applicant must provide notice to the FDA, and the FDA will publish notice of the complaint in the Federal Register. Unlike
	the Hatch-Waxman Act, under which a reference product sponsor must list its patents in the Orange Book, and the FDA will suspend its review for thirty months if a reference product sponsor files a patent infringement suit, the BPCIA does not direct
	the FDA to suspend review of the biosimilar product application as a result of the patent dispute.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For patents that are issued or
	licensed after the reference product sponsor has identified its initial list, the reference product sponsor may supplement its initial list with the additional patents within thirty days of the new patents&#146; issuance or licensing. The biosimilar
	applicant must then respond within thirty days with a statement of the factual and legal basis for its opinion that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, or that the applicant does not intend to begin marketing its product
	prior to the patent&#146;s expiration. However, these patents do not become subject to the additional negotiation and list exchange procedures of the BPCIA, but rather are subject to preliminary injunction (PI) procedures. The BPCIA requires the
	biosimilar applicant to provide 180-day notice to the reference product sponsor of the applicant&#146;s intent to market the biosimilar product, and the reference product sponsor may then seek a PI on any patents there were included on any of the
	patent lists initially exchanged between the parties, but excluded from the patent list agreed to during negotiations or from the lists that were exchanged as a result of the parties&#146; failure to reach an agreement. Both parties must reasonably
	cooperate to expedite discovery as is needed in connection with the PI motion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The BPCIA limits both the reference product sponsor and
	the biosimilar applicant from bringing actions for declaratory judgment (DJ). In particular, if the reference product sponsor has been provided confidential access to the biosimilar application, neither party may bring a DJ action before the
	reference product sponsor receives the applicant&#146;s 180-day advance notice of commercial marketing. Moreover, DJ actions may only be brought against patents for which a PI motion has been filed. Importantly, if the biosimilar applicant fails to
	respond to the reference product sponsor as required at the various steps of the BPCIA&#146;s patent dispute resolution framework, the reference product sponsor may bring a DJ action on any patent included on the reference product sponsor&#146;s
	initial list and its list of newly issued or licensed patents. If the applicant fails to provide access to the confidential information required to be provided at the start of the patent dispute process, the reference product sponsor may bring a DJ
	action on any patent that claims the biological product or its use.

	for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the

	The owner of an NDA for a branded drug product may list with the FDA certain patents whose claims allegedly cover the
	applicant&#146;s branded product. Each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) new drug application referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to
	the FDA that: (1)&nbsp;no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, referred to as a Paragraph&nbsp;I Certification; (2)&nbsp;such patent has expired, referred to as a
	Paragraph&nbsp;II Certification; (3)&nbsp;the date on which such patent expires, referred to as a Paragraph&nbsp;III Certification; or (4)&nbsp;such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product

	regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. An applicant submitting a Paragraph&nbsp;IV Certification must provide notice to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the
	holder of the approved branded drug to which the 505(b)(2) application refers. If the reference branded drug holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45&nbsp;days of the receipt of
	the Paragraph&nbsp;IV Certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30&nbsp;months from the receipt of the Paragraph&nbsp;IV Certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the

	Additionally, a 505(b)(2) application also will not
	be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the NDA branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA can delay the submission or
	the approval of certain applications for competing products. In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for a reference listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve another drug
	application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not
	been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An &#147;active moiety&#148; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#146;s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept
	for filing any application for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA&#146;s findings regarding that drug; the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a Paragraph&nbsp;IV Certification. A
	drug may obtain a three year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability
	or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA that references such product until after that three

	Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be
	eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five
	years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval
	date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent
	applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves
	the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the
	expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.

	In the case of product candidates that are intended to treat certain rare life-threatening diseases, such as our anthrax vaccine
	product candidates, conducting controlled clinical trials to determine efficacy may be unethical or unfeasible. Under regulations issued by the FDA in 2015, often referred to as the &#147;Animal Rule,&#148; the approval of such products can be based
	on clinical data from trials in healthy human subjects that demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy data from adequate and well-controlled animal studies. Among other requirements, the animal studies must establish that the drug or biological
	product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefits in humans. Because the FDA must agree that data derived from animal studies may be extrapolated to establish safety and effectiveness in humans, seeking approval under the Animal
	Rule&nbsp;may add significant time, complexity and uncertainty to the testing and approval process. In addition, products approved under the Animal Rule&nbsp;are subject to additional requirements including post-marketing study requirements,
	restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients.

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we
	obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from
	third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from
	the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for
	a particular indication. Moreover, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain

	The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment
	programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of therapeutic equivalent products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the
	Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased
	the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the
	Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, established mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part&nbsp;D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146;
	share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.

	In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of
	national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by
	the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member
	states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high
	barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

	The marketability of any products for which we and our collaboration partners receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if
	the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to
	increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory
	approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex
	legal and factual questions. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining issued claims that cover our technology and product candidates, and being able to enforce those
	claims against our competitors once granted. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice the patented
	technology in relation to the commercialization of our product candidates. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents
	and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our
	products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar
	technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for both our biosimilar and vaccine products. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that,
	before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.

	We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to
	protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. We also
	seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in
	these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by
	competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

	We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in

	With the exception of one year, we have incurred annual net operating losses since inception, and to date
	have generated only limited revenue from government contracts, service agreements, collaboration agreements, and reagent protein product sales. We have recorded net losses of $28.2 million, $9.8 million and $4.1 million for the years ending
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $141.5&nbsp;million and net working capital of $98.8 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance
	of common stock in our initial public offering, our recent follow-on offering in April 2015, the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock, our prior credit facility, and revenue from government contracts, service agreements, collaboration
	agreements and reagent protein product sales. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $106.2 million. The sale and issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in July 2014, and
	the exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares in August 2014, provided net proceeds of approximately $52.6&nbsp;million before offering expenses of approximately $2.0&nbsp;million. In April 2015, we completed a

	As we continue to develop and invest more
	resources into the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we expect that our expenses will increase substantially, and that our net operating losses will increase over the next several years. To become profitable, we must
	successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, and effectively manufacture and commercialize the product candidates we develop. If we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will
	depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates may receive approval, and our and our collaboration partners&#146; ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate
	market share for our product candidates in those markets. We may never succeed in these activities and therefore may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not
	be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify

	Development of our anthrax vaccine, Px563L, is funded by BARDA, and the development of our malaria vaccine, Px533, is funded by NIAID. The
	funding for government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations, often made on a fiscal year basis, even for programs designed to continue for several years. These appropriations can be subject to political considerations and stringent
	budgetary constraints. Additionally, our government-funded development contracts give the U.S. government the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to extend this contract for successive option periods following a base period of performance.
	The value of the services to be performed during these option periods may constitute the majority of the total value of the underlying contract. If levels of government expenditures and authorizations for biodefense decrease or shift to programs in
	areas where we do not offer products or are not developing product candidates, or if the U.S. government otherwise declines to exercise its options under its contracts with us, our business, revenue and operating results would suffer.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our current contracts with BARDA and NIAID are cost plus fixed fee contracts and potential future contracts with the U.S. government may also
	be structured this way. Under our cost plus fixed fee contract, we are allowed to recover our approved costs plus a fixed fee. The total price on a cost plus contract is based primarily on allowable costs incurred, but generally is subject to
	contract funding limitations. U.S. government regulations require us to notify our customer of any cost overruns or underruns on a cost plus contract. If we incur costs in excess of the funding limitation specified in the contract, we may not be
	able to recover those cost overruns.

	contracts with BARDA and NIAID, contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the U.S. government&#146;s convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the U.S. government
	terminates a contract for convenience, the government contractor may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the U.S. government terminates a contract for default,
	the government contractor is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. In addition, government
	contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:

	We, our CRO and our collaborators are required to comply with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by
	regulatory authorities around the world for products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we, our
	CRO or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and submission of marketing applications may be delayed or the regulatory authorities may require us to
	perform additional clinical trials before accepting our applications for review or approving marketing applications. We cannot assure that, upon inspection, a regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply or complied
	with applicable GCP regulations. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations, which are enforced by regulatory authorities. Any failure to comply with these

	Comparative clinical trials, such as the trial planned for PF582, require a substantial number of patients
	that can form the basis for generating statistically significant results. Delays in site initiation or unexpectedly low patient enrollment rates may delay the results of the clinical trial. CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a
	result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. Further, if our relationship with our CRO is terminated, we
	may be unable to enter into arrangements with an alternative CRO on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Switching or adding CROs can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural
	transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Although we carefully manage our relationship with our CROs, there can be no
	assurance that we will not encounter such challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

	We do not currently have the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture supplies

	partners, Pfizer and Strides Arcolab, to manufacture our product candidates for preclinical and clinical studies. Successfully transferring complicated manufacturing techniques to manufacturing organizations and scaling up these techniques for
	commercial quantities will be time consuming and we may not be able to achieve such transfer. Moreover, the market for contract manufacturing services for protein therapeutics is highly cyclical, with periods of relatively abundant capacity
	alternating with periods in which there is little available capacity. If our need for contract manufacturing services increases during a period of industry-wide production capacity shortage, we may not be able to produce our product candidates on a
	timely basis or on commercially viable terms. Although we generally do not begin a clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete such study, any significant delay or discontinuation in the supply of
	a product candidate for an ongoing clinical study due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing, and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates, which

	regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal
	prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates or any other product candidates or products that we may develop. Any failure or refusal to supply the components for our product candidates that
	are being developed could delay, prevent or impair clinical development or commercialization efforts. If our manufacturers were to breach or terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us, the development or commercialization of the affected
	products or product candidates could be delayed, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any change in our manufacturers could be costly because the commercial terms of any new arrangement could be less favorable and because the expenses

	The patentability of inventions, and the validity, enforceability and scope of patents in the biotechnology and
	pharmaceutical industry involve complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. This uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through either legislative action to change statutory patent law or court action that may reinterpret
	existing law in ways affecting the scope or validity of issued patents. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United&nbsp;States or foreign countries. There is a substantial amount of prior art in
	the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields, including scientific publications, patents and patent applications. Our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior
	art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. We may be unaware of certain prior art relating to our patent applications and patents, which could prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application, or result in an issued
	patent being invalidated. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents we own or license, which may result in such patents being
	narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable.

	Patents granted by the European Patent Office may be opposed by any person within nine months
	from the publication of their grant and, in addition, may be challenged before national courts at any time. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or
	prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold, license or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability
	to commercialize our product candidates. In addition, recent changes to the patent laws of the United States provide additional procedures for third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents based on patent applications filed after
	March&nbsp;15, 2013. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to our current or future product candidates is challenged, then it could threaten our ability to
	commercialize our current or future product candidates, and could threaten our ability to prevent competitive products from being marketed. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our
	current or future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to
	either (i)&nbsp;file any patent application related to our product candidates, or (ii)&nbsp;invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications. Furthermore, for applications filed before March&nbsp;16, 2013, or patents
	issuing from such applications, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the
	patent claims of our applications and patents. As of March&nbsp;16, 2013, the United&nbsp;States transitioned to a &#147;first-to-file&#148; system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by
	different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third
	party.

	patent infringement suit and provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. It is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act

	Our research, development and commercialization activities may infringe or otherwise violate or be claimed to infringe or otherwise violate

	cover various types of products or methods of use. There may also be patent applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued as patents, could be asserted against us. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the
	courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the
	patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving that a patent is invalid is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of
	validity enjoyed by issued patents. Also in proceedings before courts in Europe, the burden of proving invalidity of the patent usually rests on the party alleging invalidity. Third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur
	substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the

	A significant legal risk in pursuing regulatory approval under the 351(k) regulatory approval
	route is that the above-summarized patent exchange process established by the BPCIA could result in the initiation of patent infringement litigation prior to FDA approval of a 351(k) application, and such litigation could result in blocking the
	market entry of our products. In particular, while the 351(k) route is more attractive to us (versus 351(a)) for reasons related to development time and costs and the potential broader scope of eventual regulatory approval for our proposed
	biosimilar candidates, the countervailing risk in such a regulatory choice is that the complex patent exchange process mandated by the BPCIA could ultimately prevent or substantially delay us from launching our products in the United States.

	Moreover, the disclosure process set forth in Step 1 of the process outlined above, which is directed to disclosure by the biosimilar
	applicant of not only its regulatory application but also the applicant&#146;s manufacturing process, has the potential to afford originators an easier path than traditional infringement litigation for developing any factual grounds they may require
	to support allegations of infringement. The rules established in the BPCIA&#146;s patent dispute procedures (versus the rules governing traditional patent infringement litigation) place biosimilar firms at a significant disadvantage by affording
	originators a much easier mechanism for factual discovery, thereby increasing the risk that a biosimilar product could be blocked from the market more quickly than under traditional patent infringement litigation processes.

	Preparing for and conducting the patent exchange, briefing and negotiation process outlined above will require extraordinarily sophisticated
	legal counseling and extensive planning, all under extremely tight deadlines. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to secure such legal support if large, well-funded originators have already entered into engagements with highly qualified law firms
	or if the most highly qualified law firms choose not to represent biosimilar applicants due to their long standing relationships with originators. Furthermore, we could be at a serious disadvantage in this process as an originator company, as

	to the filing of any biosimilar regulatory application. For example, in the Sandoz case
	against the originator Amgen (relating to Sandoz&#146; proposed etanercept (Enbrel) biosimilar) the federal district court ruled that Sandoz did not have the right to bring a declaratory judgment action against Amgen to challenge the validity of
	certain Amgen-controlled patents directed to Enbrel, but instead determined that Sandoz must use the patent exchange mechanism established in the BPCIA. Sandoz appealed this decision to the United&nbsp;States Court of Appeals for the Federal
	Circuit, and on December&nbsp;5, 2014 the Federal Circuit Court ruled that Sandoz had not met the legal requirements to pursue a declaratory judgment action against Amgen. The Federal Circuit court did not address whether the patent resolution
	mechanism established in the BPCIA would preclude Sandoz from filing its declaratory judgment action against Amgen if and when it files an FDA application under the BPCIA for its etanercept biosimilar.

	In October 2014, Amgen filed suit in federal district court against Sandoz alleging that Sandoz unlawfully refused to follow the patent
	resolution provisions of the BPCIA in connection with Sandoz&#146; July 2014 regulatory approval application under 351(k) for its Neupogen (filgrastim) biosimilar, Zarxio. Amgen is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. In October 2014 Amgen
	also filed a Citizen&#146;s Petition with the FDA asking that the FDA require biosimilar applicants to comply with the BPCIA by providing to the reference product sponsor a copy of the biosimilar application accepted for review, together with
	information that fully describes the manufacture of the proposed biosimilar product, within 20 days after being informed by the FDA that the biosimilar application has been accepted for review. On March&nbsp;19, 2015, the district court refused

	provide its BLA and/or manufacturing information to the originator. The court also held that a biosimilar applicant need not wait until it receives BLA approval to provide the 180 prior day notice of commercial marketing set forth in the BPCIA
	provisions (see paragraph 8 above), but instead may provide such notice to the originator, if at all, prior to receiving FDA approval. On March&nbsp;26, 2015, the FDA denied Amgen&#146;s Citizen&#146;s Petition. More recently, on

	Non-Patent Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
</I>
	. Additionally, a 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any
	applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the NDA branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA can delay the submission or the approval of
	certain applications for competing products. In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for a reference listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve another drug application
	that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved
	by the FDA in any other NDA. An &#147;active moiety&#148; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#146;s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing
	any application for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA&#146;s findings regarding that drug; the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the 505(b)(2) applicant makes a Paragraph&nbsp;IV Certification. A drug may
	obtain a three year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or
	bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA that references such product until after that three year
	exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the entire exclusivity period.

	Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is

	candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early studies may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical studies. For example, the results
	generated to date in clinical trials for PF582 do not ensure that later clinical trials, including the planned comparative clinical trial, will demonstrate similar results. There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through
	clinical studies, and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the
	biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier clinical trials, and we cannot be certain that we will not
	face similar setbacks. Even if the clinical trials for our product candidates are completed, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory

	Since December&nbsp;31, 2015, another biosimilar was approved for Benepali (etanercept). In the United States an abbreviated pathway for approval of biosimilar products was established by the
	BPCIA, enacted on March&nbsp;23, 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The BPCIA established this abbreviated pathway under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. Subsequent to the enactment of the
	BPCIA, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding the demonstration of biosimilarity as well as the submission and review of biosimilar applications. However, the first biosimilar was just approved by the FDA on March&nbsp;6, 2015 and no biosimilar
	product that has been designed as interchangeable to the reference drug. Moreover, market acceptance of biosimilar products in the U.S. is unclear. Numerous states are considering or have already enacted laws that regulate or restrict the
	substitution by state pharmacies of biosimilars for biological products already licensed by the FDA pursuant to BLAs, or &#147;reference products&#148;. Market success of biosimilar products will depend on demonstrating to patients, physicians,

	Biosimilar products may also be subject to extensive patent clearances and patent infringement litigation, which will likely delay and could
	prevent the commercial launch of a product. Moreover, the BPCIA prohibits the FDA from accepting an application for a biosimilar candidate to a reference product within four years of the reference product&#146;s licensure by the FDA. In addition,
	the BPCIA provides innovative biologics with twelve years of exclusivity from the date of their licensure, during which time the FDA cannot approve any application for a biosimilar candidate to the reference product. For example, the FDA may not be
	able to approve any application that we or our collaborators submit for PF582 until twelve years after the original BLA for Lucentis was approved. However, in his proposed budget for fiscal year 2014, President Obama proposed to cut this twelve year
	period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to prohibit additional periods of exclusivity due to minor changes in product formulations, a practice often referred to as &#147;evergreening.&#148; It is possible that Congress may take
	these or other measures to reduce or eliminate periods of exclusivity.

	The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and
	implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning is subject to significant uncertainty. Future implementation decisions by the FDA could result in delays in the development or commercialization of our product
	candidates or increased costs to assure regulatory compliance, and could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or significantly delaying our ability to market new biosimilar products. In the EEA, holders of marketing authorizations
	of reference products (for which a marketing authorization was applied for under the centralized procedure after November&nbsp;20, 2005, or under the Decentralized, Mutual Recognition and national procedures, after October&nbsp;30, 2005) enjoy eight
	years of data exclusivity during which a follow-on product or biosimilar marketing authorization applicant cannot rely on the preclinical and clinical data included in the reference product&#146;s dossier, and ten years of marketing exclusivity
	during which a follow-on product or biosimilar of the reference product cannot be placed in the EEA market. The marketing exclusivity period can be extended one additional year (to eleven years) if a second indication of the reference product with
	significant clinical benefit is approved during the eight year data exclusivity period. The data and marketing exclusivity periods start from the date of the initial authorization, which for reference medicinal products authorized through the
	Centralized Procedure is the date of notification of the marketing authorization decision to the marketing authorization holder of the reference product. Lucentis was granted a marketing authorization by the EU Commission through the EU centralized
	procedure on January&nbsp;22, 2007.

	In addition, the FDA may determine that a proposed biosimilar product is &#147;interchangeable&#148; with a reference product, meaning that
	the biosimilar product may be substituted by a pharmacist for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product, if the application includes sufficient information to show that the
	product is biosimilar to the reference product and that it can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. If the biosimilar product may be administered more than once to a patient, the applicant
	must demonstrate that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. To make
	a final determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability, regulatory authorities may require additional confirmatory information beyond what we and our collaboration partners plan to initially submit in our applications for approval, such as
	more in-depth analytical characterization, animal testing, or further clinical studies. Provision of sufficient information for approval may prove difficult and expensive. We cannot predict whether any of our biosimilar product candidates will meet
	regulatory authority requirements for approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable product. To date, the FDA has not approved a biosimilar product as being interchangeable to the reference drug.

	Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we will be
	subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and EEA and other foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal, as well as EEA and other
	foreign, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the
	referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper
	discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with
	physicians. Further, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual
	knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute
	constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA or federal civil money penalties statute. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors. Violations of the anti-kickback laws
	can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties. The FCA imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a
	federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under
	the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the
	FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and
	other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been
	forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. Given the significant size of actual and
	potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers&#146; and manufacturers&#146; compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. If our future marketing or
	other arrangements were determined to violate anti-kickback or related laws, including the FCA, then our revenue could be adversely affected, which would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

	In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare
	providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug commercial manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by
	physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#147;knowing failures&#148;),
	for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th&nbsp;day of each calendar year. Certain

	In the United States and internationally, our and our collaboration partners&#146; ability to generate revenue on future sales of our products
	will be dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal governments and private insurance plans. Insurers have implemented cost-cutting measures and other
	initiatives to enforce more stringent reimbursement standards and likely will continue to do so in the future. These measures include the establishment of more restrictive formularies and increases in the out-of-pocket obligations of patients for
	such products. In addition, particularly in the U.S. and increasingly in other countries, we will be required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are

	In addition, in the United States, the full impact of recent healthcare reform and other changes in the
	healthcare industry and in healthcare spending is currently unknown. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act,
	was enacted with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential
	competition by lower-cost biosimilars and follow-on products, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or
	injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on
	manufacturers of certain prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable reference product drugs to
	eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the
	Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was
	unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on
	April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Tax Payer Relief Act, or ATRA, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare
	payments to several providers, including hospitals. We expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal, state and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products
	and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products, if approved, or additional pricing pressures.

	Our stock is currently traded on NYSE MKT, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market on NYSE
	MKT or any other exchange in the future. The trading volume of our stock tends to be low relative to our total outstanding shares, and we have several stockholders, including affiliated stockholders, who hold substantial blocks of our stock. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had 23,316,413 shares of common stock outstanding, and stockholders holding at least 5% of our stock, individually or with affiliated persons or entities, collectively beneficially owned or controlled approximately 55% of
	such shares. Sales of large numbers of shares by any of our large stockholders could adversely affect our trading price, particularly given our relatively small historic trading volumes. If stockholders holding shares of our common stock sell,

	In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we

	is reasonably possible that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses that we identified related to (1)&nbsp;a lack of sufficient staff to deal

	(1)&nbsp;hired outside consultants with technical skills to assist in the documentation and implementation of internal controls and flows procedures, (2)&nbsp;hired qualified personnel, including a chief financial officer during the second quarter
	of 2014, (3)&nbsp;hired additional qualified finance staff for certain key positions in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 in order to enhance oversight, review and control over financial reporting, and (4)&nbsp;established formalized and

	We have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to
	become profitable in the near future, and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under
	Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an &#147;ownership change,&#148; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain
	stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#146;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may
	be limited. We have determined that we had an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if or when we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our
	pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which
	the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes, which

	As a public company, and increasingly after we are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; we will incur significant legal,
	accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the NYSE MKT impose numerous requirements on public companies, including establishment
	and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Also, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current
	reports with respect to our business and operating results. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these laws and regulations. These requirements have increased and will continue to
	increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive
	for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain
	qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers.

	Overall, we estimate that our
	incremental costs resulting from operating as a public company, including compliance with these rules and regulations, may be between $2.0 million and $4.0 million per year. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying
	interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty
	regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and changing governance practices.

	may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company.&#148; When our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial

	connection with the initial public offering of our common stock, pursuant to which we sold 9,429,084 shares of our common stock (inclusive of 1,095,751 shares of common stock from the exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional
	shares) at a public offering price of $6.00 per share. In connection with the closing of the initial public offering, (i)&nbsp;all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into 8,634,857 shares of common stock,
	(ii)&nbsp;we issued 1,217,784 shares of our common stock to holders of our convertible preferred stock in connection with the payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends through July&nbsp;28, 2014, (iii)&nbsp;we repurchased 423,185 shares of our

	100,000&nbsp;shares of common stock. In connection with our initial public offering, we received net proceeds of approximately $52.6 million after underwriting discounts of approximately $4.0 million, but before offering expenses of approximately
	$2.0 million. William Blair&nbsp;&amp; Company, L.L.C. and JMP Securities LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the offering, and Mizuho Securities USA Inc. acted as co-manager. No payments for such expenses were made directly or indirectly

	The holders of our convertible preferred stock were entitled to cumulative dividends prior and in preference to our common stock. Because the holders of our convertible preferred stock were entitled to participate in
	dividends, net loss attributable to common stockholders was equal to net loss adjusted for convertible preferred stock dividends for the period. Immediately upon the closing of our IPO, all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred
	stock, or our convertible preferred stock, were automatically converted into an aggregate of 8,634,857&nbsp;shares of common stock and these holders were issued 1,217,784&nbsp;shares of common stock for the payment of all accrued and unpaid
	dividends through July&nbsp;28, 2014 in connection with such conversion based on the initial public offering price of $6.00 per share and the offering closing on July&nbsp;29, 2014. See Note&nbsp;14 to our financial statements for a description of
	the method used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders and for a description of convertible preferred stock, respectively. Please refer to Note&nbsp;8 of our consolidated financial statements for an

	We are a
	clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the development of biosimilar and therapeutic equivalent products to branded therapeutics and other high-value and difficult-to-manufacture proteins. Our lead product candidate is PF582, a biosimilar
	candidate to Lucentis (ranibizumab). Lucentis, marketed by Genentech, Inc., a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group and Novartis AG, for the treatment of patients with retinal diseases, achieved approximately $4.5 billion in global product sales in
	2014. For PF582, we are conducting a Phase 1b/2a trial in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, with our collaboration partner, Hospira, Inc., or Hospira, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (collectively with Hospira,
	&#147;Pfizer&#148;). Pfizer is responsible for manufacturing, clinical studies and commercialization of PF582 globally upon successful receipt of marketing approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our next most advanced product candidates are PF530 and PF708. PF530 is a biosimilar candidate to Betaseron (Interferon beta-1b) (marketed as
	Betaferon outside the United States) that is marketed by Bayer AG for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and achieved over $0.9 billion in global product sales in 2015. We initiated a pilot Phase 1 clinical trial of PF530 in the first quarter of
	2015 and enrolled 12 healthy subjects who received an initial dose of either PF530 or the reference product to assess pharmacokinetic (&#147;PK&#148;) and pharmacodynamic (&#147;PD&#148;) parameters. After a subsequent wash out period, subjects were
	crossed over to receive the other product. Based on the analysis of the trial PK and PD parameters, we announced in November 2015 that there were no statistically significant differences in PK and PD between the groups administered PF530 versus the
	reference product. While the study enrolled just 12 subjects and was therefore not powered for further statistical testing, this pilot PK/PD study has provided the necessary PK/PD variability information to advance PF530 clinical development.
	Following our discussions with the FDA, we intend to pursue an abbreviated development path for PF530 consisting of a pivotal PK/PD study in healthy subjects and an immunogenicity trial in multiple sclerosis patients, pending the agency&#146;s
	review of additional bioanalytical data. In 2016, we expect to supplement our bioanalytical package and have additional discussions with the FDA to refine the study design. We expect to initiate the clinical program in the second half of 2016. PF708
	is being developed as a therapeutically equivalent peptide to Forteo (teriparatide), marketed by Eli Lilly for the treatment of osteoporosis and achieved over $1.4 billion in global product sales in 2015. PF708 entered into a bioequivalence study at
	the end of 2015. In addition to our three most advanced product candidates, our pipeline includes four other biosimilar candidates as well as vaccines and next generation biologic candidates. To date, none of our product candidates have received
	marketing authorization from any regulatory agency, and therefore we have not received revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates.

	, which we believe confers several important competitive advantages compared to traditional techniques for protein production, including the ability to produce complex proteins with higher
	accuracy and greater degree of protein purity, as well as speed and cost advantages. The development of proteins, such as biosimilars, requires several competencies which represent both challenges and barriers to entry. Due to their inherent
	complexity, proteins require the use of living organisms to efficiently produce them at a large scale.

	Traditional techniques for protein production employ a trial and error approach to production organism, or strain, selection and process optimization, which is inherently inefficient and
	typically produces suboptimal results. This historically inefficient process provides barriers to create or replicate complex proteins, adds significant time to market and results in the high cost of goods typical of biologic therapeutics. Together,
	these limitations pose significant hurdles for companies interested in entering the market with biosimilar and therapeutic equivalents to branded products. Our platform utilizes a proprietary high throughput robotically-enabled parallel approach,
	which allows the construction and testing of thousands of unique protein production variables in parallel, thereby allowing us to produce and characterize complex proteins while reducing the time and cost of development and long-term production.

	Strides Arcolab Limited, a specialty pharmaceutical company. In addition, we are also developing proprietary vaccine candidates that are being funded by the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within

	The 2014 global biologics market represented over $234&nbsp;billion in product sales, according to BCC
	Research, with virtually the entire market comprised of branded products. We believe the emerging biosimilar market will be significant due to the large number of blockbuster products expected to lose patent protection in the next several years,
	abbreviated regulatory pathways for the approval of biosimilars and a mandate for lower drug costs by governments and private payers. A biosimilar is a biologic product that has been demonstrated to be highly similar to a biologic product that is
	already approved, referred to as a reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and where there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and the biosimilar in terms of the
	safety, purity, and potency of the product. By 2020, 11&nbsp;biologic products representing approximately $71&nbsp;billion of aggregate 2014 product sales are expected to lose patent protection and become available globally for biosimilars according
	to IMS Health. The market opportunities for our three most advanced product candidates are substantial. Lucentis achieved approximately $4.5 billion in global product sales in 2014. By the second quarter of 2018, markets with 2014 Lucentis sales of
	approximately $600&nbsp;million are expected to lose patent protection, and become available to biosimilars. Additionally, by the second quarter of 2020, markets with an additional $2.2&nbsp;billion in 2014 Lucentis sales are expected to lose patent
	protection and become available for biosimilars, and after January 2022 markets with an additional $1.6&nbsp;billion in 2014 sales are expected to also lose patent protection. Approximately $50 million in 2014 sales come from markets for which
	accurate patent expiration dates are not available.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Betaseron achieved over $0.9 billion in product sales in 2015. Interferon beta-1b
	product sales in markets where no intellectual property barriers exist totaled in excess of $34&nbsp;million in 2014 with other territories representing the balance of product sales expected to become available between 2017 and 2021. Forteo achieved
	product sales of approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion in 2015. Almost half of these product sales came from the US alone, followed by Japan. Forteo is expected to lose patent protection in the US and Japan in 2019.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $141.5 million of which $89.8 million was attributable to recognizing the
	accretion in the redemption value of our convertible preferred stock. We recognized net losses of $28.2 million, $9.8 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect to incur substantial
	and increasing losses for the next several years as we develop and advance our lead product candidates through clinical development, expand our research and development activities, and prepare for the potential commercial launch of our lead product
	candidates. As a result, our research and development expenses will increase materially as we incur further costs of development. We currently utilize third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, to carry out our clinical development and we
	do not yet have an extensive sales organization. We will need substantial additional funding to support our operating activities, especially as we approach anticipated regulatory approval in Europe, the United States and other territories, and begin
	to establish our commercialization capabilities. Adequate funding may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of common stock in
	our initial public offering, the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock, borrowings under prior credit facilities, and revenue from our collaboration agreements, service agreements, government contracts and reagent protein product sales.
	We have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our product candidates and working capital requirements. Additionally, as we continue to focus our business on the development of our product pipeline, we
	anticipate allocating fewer resources to certain aspects of our protein production activities that currently generate our revenue, which we expect will result in a decline of service-related revenue.

	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
	statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by
	us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the

	We file U.S. federal income tax returns and California, Massachusetts and Missouri state tax returns. To date, we have not been audited by the
	Internal Revenue Service or any state tax authority; however all tax years from and including 2010 remain open for examination by federal and state income tax authorities. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary
	differences are expected to reverse.&nbsp;A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the expected future impact of differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future
	tax benefit, if any, to be derived from tax credits and loss carryforwards.&nbsp;Deferred income tax expense or benefit would represent the net change during the year in the deferred income tax asset or liability.&nbsp;Deferred tax assets, if any,
	are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

	During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2013, we recorded an income tax provision of
	$0.5 million and an income tax benefit of $2.7 million, respectively, which is principally attributable to U.S. federal and state income taxes. No income tax provision was recorded during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Our practice is to
	recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We had no accrual for interest or penalties on our consolidated balance sheets at December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had federal and state research and development credits carryforwards of approximately $1.1 million and $0.1
	million, respectively, to offset potential tax liabilities. We utilized all of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal alternative minimum tax and states taxes in 2015. We had zero federal net operating loss carryforwards and $12
	thousand of state net operating loss carryforwards as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The state losses can be carried forward until 2034 unless utilized.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sections 382 and 383, annual use of our net operating loss and research and development credit
	carryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three year period. We have completed an IRC Section&nbsp;382/383 analysis regarding the limitation of net operating loss and research and
	development credit carryforwards and found that a greater than 50% cumulative change in ownership occurred in August of 2014 in conjunction with our initial public offering. We had significant built in gains; therefore all the pre-change net
	operating losses were available for utilization.

	Cost of revenue decreased by $2.6 million, or 36%, to $4.6 million in 2015 compared to $7.2 million in 2014. This decrease was due primarily to
	a net decrease of $2.0 million in costs for our proprietary novel vaccine program Px563L which is funded by a government agency, as development was completed and the manufacturing phase began in late 2015, as well as decreased costs of $0.2 million
	attributable to reduced activity related to our Px533 product candidate and a $0.1 million decrease due to reduced activity in protein services work. Given the nature of the novel vaccine development process, these costs will fluctuate depending on
	stage of development.

	Cost of revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 13%, to $7.2 million in 2014 compared to $6.4 million in 2013. This
	increase was due primarily to an increase of $2.3 million in development costs for our proprietary novel vaccine program Px563L which is funded by a government agency, offset by the lower cost of revenue associated with the one-time reagent sale to
	a single customer in 2013.

	We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash inflow from
	operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 to 18 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we
	currently expect. Further, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization sooner than planned. We currently have no credit facility or
	committed sources of capital although we may receive milestone and other contingent payments under our current license and collaboration agreements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of
	spending on our research and development efforts, the timing and success of our clinical trials, the cost and timing of regulatory clearances or approvals, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new product

	and development programs or commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements
	and other marketing and distribution arrangements.&nbsp;To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may
	have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private
	equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders&#146; rights. If we raise additional capital
	through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.

	of the JOBS Act provides that an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or

	We are
	exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result
	of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we did not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our
	cash and cash equivalents without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds, treasury obligations, short term certificates of deposit and high-grade corporate securities,
	directly or through managed funds, with maturities of six months or less. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $106.2&nbsp;million consisting of cash of $3.4 million and investments of $102.8 million in highly liquid
	U.S. money market funds. In addition, we had $4.0 million in restricted cash all invested in highly liquid U.S. money market funds.&nbsp;A portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest
	rates increase. However, because our investments are primarily short-term in duration, we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a 100 basis point movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact
	on the total value of our portfolio. We actively monitor changes in interest rates.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the total principal
	outstanding under our prior line of credit agreements was $3.8 million. The interest rates on our prior line of credit agreements bore interest at 2.00% above LIBOR or a fixed interest rate ranging from 2.25% to 2.375% as of that date. If overall
	interest rates had increased by 10% during the periods presented, our interest expense would not have been materially affected. In February 2016, the Company terminated the credit facility and repaid the amount outstanding using restricted cash.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial

	accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule for each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements

	Pfenex Inc. (&#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Pfenex&#148;) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2009. Pfenex is a clinical-stage
	biotechnology company engaged in the development of biosimilar and therapeutic equivalents to branded therapeutics and other high-value and difficult to manufacture proteins. The Company&#146;s lead product candidate is PF582, a biosimilar candidate
	to Lucentis (ranibizumab). Lucentis is marketed by Genentech, Inc., a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group and Novartis AG, for the treatment of patients with retinal diseases. The Company is conducting a Phase 1b/2a trial in patients with wet
	age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, with its collaboration partner, Hospira, Inc. (&#147;Hospira&#148;), a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (collectively with Hospira, &#147;Pfizer&#148;). Pfizer is responsible for determining the need for and
	timing of any interim analysis for the Phase 1b/2a trial. The Company expects to commence a comparative clinical study with Pfizer in 2016. Pfizer will be responsible for the manufacturing and commercialization of PF582 globally upon successful
	receipt of marketing approval. The Company&#146;s next most advanced product candidates are PF530 and PF708. PF530 is a biosimilar candidate to Betaseron (Interferon beta-1b), marketed by Bayer AG for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The pilot
	Phase 1 study for PF530 was initiated in March 2015. PF708 is a therapeutic equivalent candidate to Forteo (teriparatide), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, for the treatment of osteoporosis. PF708 entered into a bioequivalence study
	at the end of 2015. In addition to the Company&#146;s three lead product candidates, its pipeline includes four other biosimilar candidates as well as vaccine, therapeutic equivalent product candidates, and next generation biologic candidates. The

	Amended and Restated Revolving Line of Credit Note (together, the &#147;Amended Credit Facility&#148;). The Amended Credit Facility replaced the LOCs and still provided the Company with a $3.9 million revolving line of credit which the Company could
	draw upon from time to time. The proceeds of the loans under the Amended Credit Facility could be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

	The Amended Credit Facility contained customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements. The Amended Credit
	Facility also contained customary negative covenants that limited the ability of the Company to, among other things, pay cash dividends if a default was continuing or would occur as a result, incur debt, create liens and encumbrances, or redeem or
	repurchase stock for cash if a default was continuing or would occur as a result. Future U.S. subsidiaries were required to become subsidiary guarantors of all amounts owing under the Amended Credit Facility.

	The Amended Credit Facility contained customary events of default, such as the failure to pay obligations when due, initiation of bankruptcy
	or insolvency proceedings, defaults on certain other indebtedness, change of control, and material breach of representations and warranties. Upon an event of default, the lender could, subject to customary cure rights, require the immediate payment
	of all amounts outstanding and foreclose on collateral.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The termination date of the Amended Credit Facility was July&nbsp;1, 2018, when
	all outstanding loans would have become due and payable. Amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility bore an interest at a rate equal to, at the Company&#146;s option, (i)&nbsp;a fluctuating rate per annum equal to 2.25% above the
	overnight LIBOR Rate or (ii)&nbsp;a fixed rate per annum determined by Wells Fargo to be 2.00% above the LIBOR Rate in effect on the first day of each LIBOR Period.

	In December 2012, the Company and Stelis Biopharma Private Limited
	(&#147;Stelis&#148;), entered into a Joint Development&nbsp;&amp; License Agreement (&#147;JDLA&#148;), the purpose of which is to collaborate to develop certain therapeutic biosimilars through the completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial.
	Under the terms of the agreement, Stelis is responsible for paying the costs associated with the Phase 1 trials and the manufacturing of the drug product for the trials. Stelis is obligated to reimburse the Company for any and all payments made to
	third-party service providers for Phase 1 trials. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012 the total of all reimbursable costs was $0.2 million. These reimbursable costs were paid in full to Pfenex in 2013. In February 2015, the Company notified Stelis that it
	was removing PF530 Interferon beta-1b, PF726 PEGylated Interferon beta-1b and PF529 PEGylated filgrastim from the JDLA. In March 2013, the Company and Stelis entered into a joint venture agreement (&#147;JVA&#148;). The JVA was established to
	provide a vehicle for the advancement of biosimilars successful in Phase&nbsp;1 trials under the JDLA. Under the terms of the JVA, both parties share equally in all decisions, and share revenue and costs 51% to Stelis and 49% to the Company. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, there was no investment in the joint venture by the Company, and there has been no activity in the joint venture (&#147;JV&#148;) to date. Once a biosimilar product successfully completes a Phase&nbsp;1 trial and Stelis and
	the Company agree to contribute the biosimilar to the JV, the JV will incur activity.

	The fair value of equity instruments that are ultimately expected to vest, net of estimated forfeitures, are
	recognized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires multiple subjective inputs, including a measure of expected future volatility. Prior to the Company&#146;s IPO, the
	Company&#146;s stock did not have a readily available market. Consequently, the expected future volatility was based on the historical volatility for comparable publically traded companies over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated
	expected term of the Company&#146;s stock options. Following the completion of the Company&#146;s IPO in July 2014, the fair value of options granted is based on the closing price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant as quoted on
	the NYSE MKT.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates during the period appropriate for the expected
	term of the options. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding. With the exception of 1,217,784 shares of common stock issued in connection with the payment of all accrued and
	unpaid dividends on the preferred stock immediately prior to the completion of the Company&#146;s IPO, the Company had never declared or paid dividends and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the dividend yield assumption
	is based on the expectation that the Company will not pay dividends on its common stock in the future. Authoritative guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
	forfeitures differ from those estimates. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $5.91, $4.60 and $1.04 respectively. Total fair value of shares vested during the
	years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $971 thousand, $137 thousand and $57 thousand, respectively.

	Significant components of the Company&#146;s deferred
	tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 are shown below. A valuation allowance of $14.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 has been established to offset deferred tax assets as realization of such assets is uncertain with the
	exception of $2.0 million related to deferred revenue. The future reversal of the deferred revenue is a future source of income when evaluating the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance.

	The holders of the Company&#146;s convertible preferred stock were entitled to cumulative dividends prior and in preference to its common stock. Because the holders of its convertible preferred stock were entitled to
	participate in dividends, net loss attributable to common stockholders was equal to net loss adjusted for convertible preferred stock dividends for the period. Immediately upon the closing of the Company&#146;s IPO, all outstanding shares of its
	redeemable convertible preferred stock, or its convertible preferred stock, were automatically converted into an aggregate of 8,634,857&nbsp;shares of common stock and these holders were issued 1,217,784&nbsp;shares of common stock for the payment
	of all accrued and unpaid dividends through July&nbsp;28, 2014 in connection with such conversion based on the initial public offering price of $6.00 per share and the offering closing on July&nbsp;29, 2014. See Note&nbsp;14 to the Company&#146;s
	financial statements for a description of the method used to compute basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders and for a description of convertible preferred stock, respectively. Please refer to Note&nbsp;8 of the
	Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the cumulative preferred stock dividends.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
	of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term &#147;disclosure controls and procedures,&#148; as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
	recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
	to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
	functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
	and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management is
	responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
	over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded
	that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our
	independent registered public accounting firm, Haskell&nbsp;&amp; White, LLP, is not required to and has not issued an attestation report as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 due to a transition period established by the rules of the SEC for newly public
	companies that have not lost their &#147;emerging growth company&#148; status as defined in the JOBS Act.

	by Rule&nbsp;13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
	that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible
	controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all

	control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
	can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls
	also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become
	inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
	detected.
