<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are focused on becoming the
	world leader in novel antibiotics against infectious disease and on developing effective treatments for oral mucositis. We also develop, market, and sell proprietary probiotics specifically designed to enhance oral health for humans and pets, under
	the brand names Evora and ProBiora.

	Our Antibiotic Product Candidate
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Members of our scientific team discovered that a certain bacterial strain produces MU1140, a molecule belonging to the novel class of antibiotics known as
	lantibiotics. Lantibiotics, such as MU1140, are highly modified peptide antibiotics made by a small group of Gram positive bacterial species. Approximately 60 lantibiotics have been discovered. We believe lantibiotics are generally recognized by the
	scientific community to be potent antibiotic agents.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In nonclinical testing, MU1140 has shown activity against all Gram positive bacteria against which
	it has been tested, including those responsible for a number of healthcare associated infections, or HAIs. A high percentage of hospital-acquired infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
	(MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We believe the need for novel antibiotics is increasing as a result of the growing resistance of target pathogens to existing FDA approved antibiotics on the market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Lantibiotics have been difficult to investigate for their clinical usefulness as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of infectious diseases due to a general
	inability to produce or synthesize sufficient quantities of pure amounts of these molecules. Traditional fermentation methods can only produce minute amounts of the lantibiotic.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2012, we entered into the Lantibiotic Exclusive Channel Collaboration agreement (&#147;Lantibiotic ECC&#148;) with Intrexon Corporation
	(&#147;Intrexon&#148;) for the development and commercialization of the native strain of MU1140 and related homologs using Intrexon&#146;s advanced transgene and cell engineering platforms. Through our work with Intrexon, we have been able to
	produce a significant increase in the fermentation titer of MU1140 compared to standard fermentation methods and have discovered a new purification process for MU1140. Our work with Intrexon has generated a substantial number of homologs of MU1140,
	and we are continuing our research and development and collaboration efforts with Intrexon to develop potential derivatives of the MU1140 molecule using genetically modified bacteria.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our pre-clinical studies to support a potential Investigational New Drug (&#147;IND&#148;) filing with the FDA, we tested a total of six homologs of MU1140
	for certain compound characteristics, including but not limited to: drug activity (based on minimum inhibitory concentration or &#147;MIC&#148;) equal or better than &#147;standard of care&#148; drugs against certain drug-resistant bacteria, safety,
	toxicity, stability, and manufacturability. The study specifically evaluated homolog efficacy in relation to survival, measurable amounts of
<I>
	c. diff
</I>
	colony forming units, and toxin levels. Three homologs demonstrated promising results with
	one homolog, which is our current lead compound, achieving a 100% survival rate throughout the entire study in contrast to an approximately 30% survival rate for the vancomycin positive control.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have selected a lead candidate, OG253, and have had a pre IND meeting with the FDA in November of 2015. We will continue our research and development

	In June of 2015, we
	entered into a worldwide Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (&#147;Oral Mucositis ECC&#148;) with Intrexon and Intrexon Actobiotics NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrexon, pursuant to which we obtained certain exclusive rights to AG013 as

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In a Phase 1b clinical trial in 25 cancer patients with OM, AG013
	was safe and well tolerated. Data published in the journal
<U>
	Cancer
</U>
	showed a 35% reduction of the duration of ulcerative OM in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, close to 30% of the patients treated
	with AG013 were full responders while all placebo-treated patients developed ulcerative OM. Additionally, in a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study in 10 healthy volunteers, During the first quarter of 2016, we conducted a confirmatory animal study on
	AG013. We will use the results from that confirmatory study as we move towards a meeting with the Food and Drug Administration with the goal of launching a Phase 2 trial on AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients.
	AG013 bacteria adhered to the buccal mucosa and actively secreted protein locally, resulting in homogeneous exposure to the entire mucosal surface up to 24 hours after administration of a rinse. AG013 has been granted Orphan Drug status in the
	European Union and we believe it may be eligible for Biologic License Application exclusivity as well as Fast Track designation with the United States Food and Drug Administration.

	In the course of research and development, MU1140 was found to be a potent antibiotic that is naturally produced by the parent of the SMaRT strain. MU1140

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On June&nbsp;5, 2012, we entered into the Lantibiotic ECC with Intrexon. Through this collaboration we intend to develop lantibiotics, a novel class of broad
	spectrum antibiotics, as active pharmaceutical ingredients toward the goal of commercialization for the treatment of infectious diseases in humans. Intrexon is a leader in the field of synthetic biology and we believe a portion of their technologies
	covered by the Lantibiotic ECC helped to produce sufficient quantities of native MU1140 as well as a potential pipeline of other MU1140 homologs to initiate nonclinical testing.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of this ECC, we have selected a lead candidate, OG253, and had a pre IND meeting with the FDA in November of 2015. We will continue our research

	The most common HAIs are caused by drug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant
<I>
	Staphylococcus aureus
</I>
	, or MRSA;
	vancomycin-resistant
<I>
	Enterococcus faecalis
</I>
	, or VRE; and
<I>
	Clostridium difficile,
</I>
	or
<I>
	C. diff
</I>
	. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, HAIs are estimated to occur in approximately 5% of all acute-care
	hospitalizations. The CDC also estimates that the total direct medical cost to the U.S. healthcare system from HAIs is between $28.4 billion to $45 billion annually. Cubicin, a Gram positive lipopeptide antibiotic which was launched in the US market
	in November 2003 by the biotechnology company Cubist, had 2012 global sales of $926.4 million. In 2013, Cubist announced the acquisition of two companies Optimer and Trius each of which was for consideration over $800M. In 2015, Cubist was acquired
	by Merck for a total transaction value of $9.5&nbsp;billion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The need for novel antibiotics is increasing as a result of the growing resistance of the
	targeted pathogens. The CDC has estimated that up to 77% of certain nosocomial pathogenic bacteria are resistant to drugs of last resort (vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and vancomycin, respectively, in this example). HAIs are not exclusively a
	problem in the United States as the rest of the world has also seen a dramatic rise in HAIs during the last decade. We believe novel antibiotics have become increasingly scarce as major pharmaceutical companies focus more research and development
	resources on lifestyle drugs and fewer resources on specialty pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics. Between 1983 and 1987, 16 new antibiotics were approved by the FDA. Twenty years later, over an equivalent time period from 2003 to 2007, only five
	new antibiotics were approved by the FDA, of which only two possessed a novel mechanism of action. Between 2008 and 2012, there were only two new antibiotics approved by FDA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Lantibiotics such as MU1140 are highly modified peptide antibiotics made by a small group of Gram positive bacterial species. Approximately 60 lantibiotics
	have been discovered since the first lantibiotic, nisin, was discovered. Lantibiotics are known to be potent antibiotic agents; however, attempts to investigate their clinical usefulness have generally met with failure due to the inability to
	produce sufficient pure amounts of any of these molecules to be able to test them as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases. Standard fermentation methods, such as those used to make a variety of other antibiotics, have
	historically resulted in the production of only minute amounts of the lantibiotic.

	efficacy studies in animals for selected candidates. This work is being done primarily through the use of outside contractors. Pursuit of clinical trials toward the goal of ultimately obtaining regulatory approval will depend upon further successful
	advancements in our research collaboration efforts with Intrexon and our efforts to have additional product manufactured. Developments from these efforts will dictate our regulatory path. We selected a lead candidate, OG253, and we will continue our

	Through our work with Intrexon, we have been able to produce a significant increase in the fermentation titer of the target compound MU1140 and the discovery
	of a new purification process for MU1140. We continue to improve on the manufacturing through collaborations with fermentation and purification experts and third party CROs, and through the hire of key personnel who will be able to further optimize
	and scale up the production/purification scheme internally. Our determination to examine many new homologs of MU1140 resulted in the need to reproduce the fermentation and purification steps on at least 10-15 identified homolog candidates. Each
	homolog requires different optimizations for both the fermentation and purification steps and in many cases required a new approach. As such our work on the development of new lantibiotic homologs using genetically modified bacteria continues. We
	believe these developments represent progress toward our goal of commercial production of sufficient quantities of a MU1140 homolog and deliver a step in validating the lantibiotics platform targeting infectious diseases.

	products are relatively more common in Asia and Europe, accounting for 42% and 30% of the global market. The probiotics market in the United States, however, is emerging, and products that address gastrointestinal problems and other uses are rapidly
	becoming available, especially as dietary supplements and cultured foods and beverages. According to Transparency Market research (http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/probiotics-market.html), probiotic foods&nbsp;&amp; beverages are the
	dominant segments in the global market and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2013 to 2018. Probiotic demand for food&nbsp;&amp; beverage segment is estimated to reach USD 37.9 billion in 2018. Following food and beverages, the market for

	S. oralis
</I>
	and
<I>
	S. uberis
</I>
	are commonly found in
	significant amounts, and conversely, the levels of bacteria associated with a disruption of gum health are usually quite low. The opposite situation prevails in periodontal disease sites, where the beneficial bacteria,

	S. oralis

<I>
	S.

	, are usually undetectable. Our scientists have demonstrated that
<I>
	S. oralis
</I>
	and
<I>
	S. uberis
</I>
	produce hydrogen peroxide, which interferes with the growth of certain potentially harmful anaerobic bacteria, and also gently and
	naturally whitens teeth. The third bacterial strain in our ProBiora3 blend,
<I>
	S. rattus

	quantity and name of each product ordered. The distributor is generally required to make guaranteed minimum purchases during a specified time period to maintain exclusivity. In the event such guaranteed minimums are not met, we may terminate the
	distribution agreement. Distributors are required to pay an advance equal to part of the price of the product. We require the distributor to maintain liability insurance. All rights terminate upon expiration or termination of the agreement. For
	international distribution agreements, payment is to be made to us in U.S. currency and we pay no taxes or other fees assessed by any governmental entity in connection with the international sale of ProBiora3 products.

	Texas A&amp;M License Agreement
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2011, we
	entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Texas A&amp;M University System (College Station, TX) (&#147;Texas A&amp;M&#148;) for access to new homologs of the lantibiotic Mutacin 1140 (MU1140) and other lantibiotics with improved
	pharmacological properties and structural features. These novel antibiotics may be useful to treat or prevent colonization and/or infections by one or more types of bacteria. The structural changes available to us from this license agreement may
	improve the bioactivity of MU1140. Under the terms of the Texas A&amp;M license agreement, we filed two patent applications with the US Patent Office to secure the intellectual property related to these new lantibiotic homologs on February&nbsp;27,
	2012, entitled &#147;Variants of the Lantibiotic MU1140 and Other Lantibiotics with Improved Pharmacological Properties and Structural Features&#148; and &#147;Replacement Therapy for Dental Carries.&#148; The patent filed for Replacement Therapy
	for Dental Carries was issued on February&nbsp;16, 2016, No.&nbsp;9,260,488 and will expire on February&nbsp;16, 2036. We have had a longstanding relationship with Dr.&nbsp;James Leif Smith, one of the co-authors of the patent application.
	Dr.&nbsp;Smith is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biology at Texas A&amp;M University and the Founder and Chair of Biotech Analyst Group, LLC, since 2006.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the license agreement, we made an initial payment of five thousand dollars ($5,000) to Texas A&amp;M. We must also pay to Texas A&amp;M a
	royalty of five percent (5%)&nbsp;of net sales of products that include the licensed technology, subject to royalty stacking provisions with a two percent (2%)&nbsp;minimum royalty. Additionally, in order to maintain the exclusive license,
	commencing in 2014 and each year thereafter prior to the calendar year of the first sale of products using the licensed technology), we must pay Texas A&amp;M $15,000 as minimum consideration for the continuation of the license agreement. Once we
	commence the sale of products that include the technology we license from Texas A&amp;M we must pay a minimum annual amount of $100,000 to Texas A&amp;M and every year thereafter through the expiration of the Agreement. However, once sales begin,
	any royalty payments we make on net sales will be credited against the $100,000 required maintenance payment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We must also pay all patent costs and
	expenses for the preparation, filing, prosecution, issuance and maintenance of the patent rights. We have agreed to indemnify and hold the Texas A&amp;M harmless from any damages caused as a result of alleged infringement of a third party&#146;s
	intellectual property rights or as a result of the production, manufacture, sale, use, lease, consumption or advertisement of the product. Sales by sublicensees are subject to the royalty rate above, and we shall be responsible for certain payments
	to Texas A&amp;M for any other consideration received that is not in the form of a royalty.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to the Texas A&amp;M license agreement, we are
	obligated to meet the following milestones and make milestone payments: (i)&nbsp;enrollment of first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial using the licensed technology, to occur on or before June&nbsp;1, 2015, with a milestone achievement payment of
	$50,000 , (ii)&nbsp;completion of Phase 2 clinical trial of a product using the licensed technology to occur on or before June&nbsp;1, 2019, with a milestone achievement payment of $100,000, (iii)&nbsp;completion of Phase 3 clinical trial of a
	product using the licensed technology to occur on or before June&nbsp;1, 2022, with a milestone achievement payment of $150,000, and (iv)&nbsp;first sale of a product using the licensed technology to occur on or before June&nbsp;1, 2025 with a
	milestone achievement payment of $400,000. If we fail to accomplish the milestones or fail to achieve net sales of products including the licensed technology for two consecutive calendar years once sales begin, Texas A&amp;M, at its sole option may
	waive the requirement, negotiate the missed milestones or terminate the license agreement. In addition, products using the licensed technology must be substantially manufactured in the United States. We expect to seek an amendment to extend the
	enrollment milestones.

	All facilities engaged in manufacturing, processing, packing or holding food for consumption in the United States must be registered with FDA before such

	Acceptable claims for foods fall into three categories: health claims, structure/function claims and nutrient content claims. Health claims describe a
	relationship between a food, food component, or dietary ingredient and reducing the risk of a disease or health-related condition. The FDA authorizes these types of health claims based on an extensive review of the scientific literature, generally
	as a result of the submission of a health claim petition. Manufacturers also may make certain health claims based on &#147;authoritative statements&#148; from a scientific body of the U.S. Government or the National Academy of Sciences.
	Structure/function claims describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect or maintain normal structure or function of the body, and may characterize the means by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such
	structure or function. Nutrient content claims expressly or by implication characterize the level of a nutrient in a food, by using terms such as &#147;free,&#148; &#147;high&#148; or &#147;low.&#148; The FDA&#146;s regulations define the nutrient
	content claims that may be used and the requirements for making such claims.

	the net quantity, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer or distributor, the ingredient list, and a Nutrition Facts label. In addition to the information required to be in a Nutrition Facts label, other nutrients must be included in the
	Nutrition Facts label if the nutrients are added as a nutrient supplement to the food, if the label makes a nutrition claim about them, or if advertising or product literature connects the nutrients to the food. The FDA considers information that is

	Under the FDCA, any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food ingredient, which is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA, unless
	the substance is Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS, which means that the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the
	substance is otherwise excluded from the definition of a food ingredient. Under FDA&#146;s regulations, the use of a food substance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures that may be voluntarily submitted to the FDA, or, for a substance
	used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as required to obtain approval of the substance as a
	food ingredient and ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in foods requires a substantial
	history of consumption for food use by a significant number of consumers. To be considered &#147;safe&#148; for its intended use, there must be a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under its
	intended conditions of use. The specific data and information that demonstrate safety depend on the characteristics of the substance, the estimated dietary intake, and the population that will consume the substance.

	The Dietary
	Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, amended the FDCA by establishing regulatory standards with respect to dietary supplements, and defining dietary supplements as a new category of food. Dietary supplements include vitamins,
	minerals, amino acids, nutritional supplements, herbs and botanicals intended for ingestion that are labeled as dietary supplements and are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet. Under DSHEA, a firm
	that manufactures or distributes dietary supplements must determine that such products are safe and that any representations or claims made about the products are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that the claims are not false or
	misleading. DSHEA does not require manufacturers or distributors to seek approval from the FDA before producing or selling a dietary supplement unless the supplement contains one or more ingredients that are considered to be a &#147;new dietary
	ingredient.&#148; A &#147;new dietary ingredient&#148; is one that was not marketed in the United States before October&nbsp;15, 1994. The manufacturer or distributor of a dietary supplement that contains a &#147;new dietary ingredient&#148; must
	provide the FDA with information, including any citations to published articles, demonstrating why the ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for use in a dietary supplement at least 75 days before the dietary supplement is introduced or
	delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. This requirement does not apply if the ingredient has been recognized as a food substance and is present in the food supply.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because dietary supplements are foods, manufacturers of dietary supplements must register the facilities where the supplements are manufactured, processed,
	packed or held with the FDA before such activities begin. Those who manufacture, package or hold dietary supplements also must comply with GMPs for dietary supplements. According to the GMPs, dietary supplements must be prepared, packaged, labeled
	and held in compliance with specific requirements, including detailed quality control requirements, such as those for maintaining and cleaning facilities and instruments, hiring and training personnel and ensuring the appropriate manufacturing
	environment, testing requirements, recordkeeping requirements and handling of customer complaints. Anyone who manufactures, packages, labels or holds dietary supplements must evaluate and ensure the identity, purity, strength and composition of the
	products. FDA regulations also require that certain information appear on dietary supplement labels, including the name of the dietary supplement, the amount of the dietary supplement, nutrition labeling, a complete list of ingredients and the name

	The FDA may take action to restrict use of a dietary supplement or to remove it from the marketplace if the agency believes the supplement presents a
	significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use suggested in the labeling or under ordinary conditions of use. Under DSHEA, the FDA bears the burden of proof to show that a dietary supplement presents a significant or
	unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The FDA also may take enforcement action against a dietary supplement manufacturer or distributor for unlawful promotion of a dietary supplement, such as making claims that a supplement treats, prevents or
	cures a specific disease or condition. These claims would subject the dietary supplement to regulation as a drug product. If dietary supplements do not meet applicable requirements, the manufacturer may need to undertake a voluntary recall.

	FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA. In most cases, the BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA may deny a BLA or NDA if all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional data, including clinical,
	toxicology, safety or manufacturing data. It can take several years for the FDA to approve a BLA or NDA once it is submitted, if at all, and the actual time required for any product candidate may vary substantially, depending upon the nature,
	complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve a BLA or NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Medical devices also are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. To be commercially distributed in the United States, devices that are not exempt from
	FDA&#146;s premarket notification, or 510(k) procedures, or are pre-amendment devices, meaning they were on the market prior to May&nbsp;28, 1976, must receive either 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval, or PMA, from the FDA prior to marketing.
	Devices are assigned to one of three classes depending on the controls the FDA deems necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the devices. Devices deemed to pose the least risk are placed in Class I. A Class I device is 510(k) exempt
	unless the device is intended for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or the device presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Class II devices require the manufacturer to submit a
	pre-market notification to FDA unless they are 510(k) exempt. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)
	cleared device and certain other devices are placed in Class III. Most Class III devices require approved PMAs before marketing, although some Class III devices can get to market through the 510(k) process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is &#147;substantially
	equivalent&#148; to a &#147;predicate device,&#148; which is a previously 510(k) cleared Class I or Class II device, a pre-amendment Class III device for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications or a device that was in commercial
	distribution before May&nbsp;28, 1976. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the applicant must show that the device has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate, or if the device has different
	technological characteristics than the predicate, the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness, and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate. The FDA&#146;s 510 (k)&nbsp;clearance pathway usually takes from four to
	twelve months, but it can last longer. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k)
	clearance or could require a PMA approval.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A product not eligible for 510(k) clearance must follow the PMA pathway, which requires proof that there is a
	reasonable assurance of a device&#146;s safety and efficacy to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction. The PMA pathway is much more costly and lengthy than the 510(k) pathway. A PMA application typically must provide extensive nonclinical and clinical trial
	data and also information about the device and its components including, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer&#146;s facilities for compliance with
	quality system regulation requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. Upon acceptance by the FDA of what it considers a completed

	Even if regulatory clearances or approvals for our product candidates are obtained, our products and the facilities manufacturing our products, including
	foods, will be subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA may perform these inspections at any time without advanced notice. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require us to engage in
	post-marketing testing and surveillance and to monitor the safety and efficacy of our products. Holders of an approved NDA, BLA, or PMA, or 510(k) clearance are subject to several post-market requirements, including the reporting of certain adverse
	events involving their products to the FDA, provision of updated safety and efficacy information, and compliance with requirements concerning the advertising and promotion of their products.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA will inspect manufacturing facilities to confirm that the facilities comply with GMP requirements. To comply with GMP requirements, manufacturers must
	expend money, time and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance. For example, manufacturers of biologic products must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet high standards of sterility, safety,
	purity, potency and identity, and must report to the FDA any deviations from GMP or any unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect a product&#146;s safety, purity, or potency. The regulations also impose documentation requirements and require
	manufacturers of drugs, biologics or devices to investigate and correct any unexplained discrepancy or the failure of a lot or unit to meet any of its specifications.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements may subject manufacturers and distributors to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions
	could include, among other things, warning letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil money penalties, fines, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Further, the FDA

	commerce. The Federal Trade Commission Act also provides that the dissemination or the causing to be disseminated of any false advertisement pertaining to drugs or foods, which would include dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive act or
	practice. Under the FTC&#146;s Substantiation Doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a &#147;reasonable basis&#148; for all objective product claims before the claims are made. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either
	deceptive or unfair practices. Pursuant to this FTC requirement we are required to have adequate substantiation for all advertising claims made for our products.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Many of our existing and potential competitors are large, well established pharmaceutical, chemical or healthcare companies with considerably greater research

	inhibit our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates; obtain approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for products more rapidly than we do; or develop treatments or cures that are safer or more effective than
	those we propose to develop. These competitors may also devote greater resources to marketing or selling their products and may be better able to withstand price competition. In addition, these competitors may introduce or adapt more quickly to new
	technologies or scientific advances, which could render our technologies obsolete, and may introduce products or technologies that make the continued development, production, or marketing of our product candidates uneconomical. These competitors may
	also be more successful in negotiating third-party licensing or collaborative arrangements and may be able to take advantage of acquisitions or other strategic opportunities more readily than we can. These actions by competitors or potential

	five U.S. patent applications pending, twenty seven foreign issued patents, and twenty-two foreign patent applications pending. In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have licenses for approximately five U.S. issued patents, zero U.S. patent
	applications pending, eleven foreign issued patents and zero foreign patent application pending. We reassess the value of each patent at the time maintenance fees are due, and in cases where maintaining the patent is judged to be of no significant
	strategic value we decline to pay the fee.

	The effect of the issued patents is that they provide us with patent protection for the claims covered by the patents. While the expiration of a product
	patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered product or product candidate, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from: (i)&nbsp;later-granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical
	method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii)&nbsp;patents relating to the use of such product; (iii)&nbsp;patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and (iv)&nbsp;in the United States and certain other
	countries, market exclusivity that may be available under relevant law. The effect of patent expiration on products or product candidates also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it,
	the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in
	other countries.

	unissued U.S. patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of eighteen months and U.S. patent applications filed prior to November&nbsp;29, 2000 are not disclosed until such patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries in
	the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent
	office, or for United States patent applications filed before March 16, 2013, in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, or in United States

	We attempt to protect our trade secrets, including the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our technologies, through the use of

	We have incurred significant net
	losses and negative cash flow in each year since our inception, including net losses of approximately $11.7 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 our accumulated
	deficit was approximately $87.6 million. We have devoted a significant amount of our financial resources to research and development, including our nonclinical development activities and clinical trials, and currently we only have our ProBiora3
	products available for commercial sale which to date has not generated significant revenue. We expect that the costs associated with our exclusive channel partnerships with Intrexon in the areas of lantibiotics (&#147;Lantibiotics Program&#148;) and
	Oral Mucositis (&#147;Oral Mucositis Program&#148;) and the development and commercialization of our product candidates under the Lantibiotics Program (which includes MU1140 homologs) using Intrexon&#146;s advanced transgene and cell engineering
	platforms will continue to increase the level of our overall expenses significantly going forward. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. These losses and negative cash
	flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our shareholders&#146; equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately
	predict the timing or amount of substantial expenses or when, or if, we will be able to generate the revenue necessary achieve or maintain profitability.

	Developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials and
	establishing manufacturing capabilities, is expensive. We anticipate that our cash resources as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 will be sufficient to fund our operations as presently structured through the end of June 2016. However, changes may occur that
	would consume our existing capital prior to that time, including the scope and progress of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our actual costs, as well as the actual revenues from sales of our ProBiora3 products, may
	ultimately vary from our current expectations, which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations. Our current cash, cash
	equivalents and short-term investments are not sufficient to fully implement our business strategy and sustain our operations over a longer period of time. Accordingly, we will need to seek additional sources of financing and such additional
	financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate
	collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to complete existing nonclinical and planned clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA
	and other regulatory authorities. We expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, and research and development activities. Specifically, we may need to raise additional

	Few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often

	Corporation to use its advanced transgene and cell engineering platforms to achieve sufficient production quantities of MU1140. While preliminary results from these efforts have demonstrated progress in the increase in production of MU1140, we will
	need to contract with a third party manufacturer to produce additional quantities of each homolog in order to be able to pursue further nonclinical testing. If we are not able to utilize fermentation methodologies for large-scale manufacture, we
	will be unable to partner and generate revenues from this product candidate and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. The manufacturing of MU1140 homologs or any other possible antibiotic

	are additional risks that such efforts will not be successful. The Intrexon technology may not be feasible to efficiently develop methodologies to enable large scale manufacturing of a MU1140 homolog or other antibiotic product candidates.
	Third-party manufacturers must have additional technical skills and must take multiple steps to attempt to control the manufacturing processes. If we are unable to produce MU1140 homologs in large-scale commercial quantities, we will be unable to

	As we continue our development of product candidates, we intend to either license these product candidates to, or partner with, one
	or more major pharmaceutical companies at the earliest possible time in their product development. If we do so, we intend for these licensees or partners to pay the costs associated with any remaining development work, regulatory submissions,
	clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates. If we are unable to license our product candidates or otherwise partner with third parties, we will have to fund the costs of our clinical trials ourselves or we will be
	unable to extract any value from these technologies. We will also have to establish our own manufacturing facilities and find our own distribution channels. This would greatly increase our future capital requirements and we cannot assure you that we
	would be able to obtain the necessary financing to pay these costs or that we will be generating significant revenues from any of our products, such as ProBiora3, sufficient to cover the associated costs. If we do not generate sufficient revenues to

	Our dependence on collaborative arrangements with third parties subjects us to a number of risks. These collaborative arrangements may not be on terms
	favorable to us. Agreements with collaborative partners typically allow partners significant discretion in electing whether or not to pursue any of the planned activities. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborative
	partners may devote to products based on the collaboration, and our partners may choose to pursue alternative products. Our partners may not perform their obligations as expected. Business combinations or significant changes in a collaborative
	partner&#146;s business strategy may adversely affect a partner&#146;s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under the arrangement. Moreover, we could become involved in disputes with our partners, which could lead to delays or
	termination of the collaborations and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. Even if we fulfill our obligations under a collaborative agreement, our partner may be able to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances. If any
	collaborative partner were to terminate or breach our agreement with it, or otherwise fail to complete its obligations in a timely manner, our chances of successfully commercializing our product candidates would be materially and adversely affected.

	able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks and licenses. Patent protection generally involves complex legal and factual
	questions and, therefore, enforceability of patent rights cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide adequate
	protection against competitors. In addition, any future patent applications may fail to result in patents being issued. Also, those patents that are issued may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against

	We cannot assure you that clinical trials will
	demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of any of our product candidates, or will otherwise satisfy regulatory requirements. Our nonclinical studies or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, there may be inconsistencies
	between early clinical trial results and results obtained in later clinical trials, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often
	susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval for their
	products. If we are unable to resolve the FDA&#146;s concerns, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for these product candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	pre-marketing approval process can be particularly expensive, uncertain and lengthy, and a number of products for which FDA or other governmental regulatory approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing. In
	addition to testing and approval procedures, extensive regulations also govern marketing, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, and record-keeping procedures. If we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such violations could result
	in warning letters, non-approval, suspensions of regulatory approvals or ongoing clinical trials, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.

	We may encounter such delays and rejection of our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authority may also adversely affect our business. Such
	delays or rejection may be encountered due to, among other reasons, government or regulatory delays, lack of efficacy during clinical trials, unforeseen safety issues, or changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development. More
	stringent regulatory approval processes in product clearance and enforcement activities could result in our experiencing longer approval cycles, more uncertainty, greater risk, and higher expenses. Even if regulatory approval of a product is
	granted, this approval may entail limitations on uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted. It is possible, for example, that we may not receive FDA approval to market products based on our licensed, patented product candidates for
	different indications or to market updated products that represent extensions of our basic product candidates. In addition, we may not receive FDA approval to export our products based on our licensed, patented product candidates in the future, and
	countries to which products are to be exported may not approve them for import.

	From time to time, legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced

	The commercial success of our ProBiora3 products, our MU1140 and homologs antibiotic product candidates, and any of our other product candidates and
	technologies, will depend in part on market acceptance by consumers. Biopharmaceutical companies have received substantial support from the scientific community, regulatory agencies and many governmental officials in the United States and
	internationally. Future scientific developments, media coverage and political events may diminish such support. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims that health products are unsafe for consumption or pose unknown risks to the environment or
	to traditional social or economic practices. Securing governmental approvals for, and consumer confidence in, such products poses numerous challenges, particularly outside the United States. The market success of product candidates developed by
	biopharmaceutical companies could be delayed or impaired in certain geographical areas as a result. Products based on our product candidates may compete with a number of traditional dental therapies and drugs manufactured and marketed by major
	pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Market acceptance of products based on our product candidates will depend on a number of factors including potential advantage over alternative treatment methods. We can offer you no assurance
	that dentists, physicians, patients or the medical and dental communities in general will accept and utilize products developed from our product candidates. If they do not, we may be unable to generate significant revenues from our product
	candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.

	that treatment costs using the new product are equal to or less than what is currently covered for other products. If our products do not receive favorable third-party reimbursement and patients are unwilling or unable to pay for our products

	directed at lowering the total cost of health care. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of
	healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Federal
	and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, controlling the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or

	As of March&nbsp;30, 2016, the KFLP, together with members of the Koski family, beneficially owns approximately
	27.8%&nbsp;of our outstanding shares of common stock and Intrexon, together with its CEO, beneficially owns approximately 33.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Additionally, Christine L. Koski and Robert C. Koski, serve on our Board of
	Directors. As a result, our principal shareholders have the ability&nbsp;to affect the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, amending our charter or by-laws, and agreeing to or
	preventing mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all our assets. In particular, this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise
	discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the
	market price for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders, and, accordingly, our majority shareholders could cause us
	to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. The significant concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors&#146; perception that conflicts of
	interest may exist or arise. However with respect to Intrexon, the Stock Issuance Agreement we entered into with Intrexon on June&nbsp;5, 2012, contains a standstill provision pursuant to which, among other things, Intrexon has agreed that until
	June&nbsp;5, 2015, subject to certain exceptions and unless invited in writing by the Company to do so, neither Intrexon nor its affiliates will, directly or indirectly: (i)&nbsp;effect or seek, initiate, offer or propose to effect, or cause or
	participate in any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company; any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company; any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other

	reasonably expected to force the Company to make a public announcement regarding any such matters; or (v)&nbsp;enter into any agreements, discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. This standstill

	Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares, except where
	shareholder approval is required by law. Any issuance of additional equity securities by us in the future could result in dilution to our existing shareholders. Such issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium to the
	then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses, acquiring or licensing additional products or brands, or establishing strategic
	relationships with targeted customers and suppliers. In order to do so, or to finance the cost of our other activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could result in further dilution to our existing shareholders. These issuances
	would dilute your percentage ownership interest, which would have the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which our shareholders vote, and might dilute the book value of our common stock. For example, we have recently issued a
	significant number of shares of our common stock in connection with financings and establishing strategic relationships and as a result our outstanding shares have increased from 27,382,830 shares as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 to 39,858,540 shares as

	Historically, the daily trading
	volume of our common stock has been relatively low and on some days our stock does not trade at all. An order for the purchase or sale of a large number of our shares could significantly affect the price at which the order is executed. We cannot
	guarantee that an active public market for our common stock will be sustained or that the average trading volume will increase. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Volatility in the
	market price for particular companies has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating
	performance. In addition, securities class action litigation has often been initiated following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#146;s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs,
	potential liabilities, and the diversion of management&#146;s attention and resources. To the extent our stock price fluctuates or remains low, it could impair our ability to raise capital through the offering of additional equity securities.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception
	that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. We have recently issued a significant number of shares of common stock and the number of
	outstanding shares has increased from 27,382,830 shares as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 to 39,858,540 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31,
	2015, there were 39,858,540 shares of our common stock outstanding, with another 175,584 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants to investors, 1,471,031 shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding and an additional 651,507
	shares available for option grants under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. The issuance of shares of our common stock under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is covered by Form S-8 registration statements we filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, or SEC, and upon exercise of the options, such shares may be resold into the market. We have also issued shares of common stock and warrants in connection with previous private placements. Such shares are available for resale as well as
	certain of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We have also issued shares of our common stock in the private placement and financing transaction, which are deemed to be &#147;restricted securities,&#148; as that term
	is defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and such shares may be resold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144. For example, on September&nbsp;30, 2013 we issued 1,348,000 restricted shares
	of our common stock to Intrexon as part of the technology access fee for the LBPs ECC and on the same date we also sold 1,300,000 restricted shares of our common stock to Intrexon in a private placement. The resale of shares acquired from us in
	private transactions could cause our stock price to decline significantly.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, from time to time, certain of our shareholders may be eligible to
	sell all or some of their restricted shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six-month holding
	period: (i)&nbsp;affiliated shareholders, or shareholders whose shares are aggregated, may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then-outstanding shares
	of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and (ii)&nbsp;non-affiliated shareholders may sell without such limitations, in each case provided we are current in our public
	reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one-year holding period without any limitation or restriction.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly; and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements.
	Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified

	As a public company we are also required to assess our internal control over financial reporting under
	Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and file periodic reports with the SEC. If we are unable to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if material weaknesses or significant deficiencies persist, the market price of our stock
	could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or regulatory investigations, which could harm our business. We must perform an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our
	internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant
	management efforts. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the SEC reporting requirements in a timely manner, or if we continue to note or identify deficiencies in our internal control over
	financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial
	and management resources. As a smaller reporting company, we do not have to have our independent registered public accounting firm report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If in the future we no longer meet the
	requirements of a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm will have to report on our internal controls over financial reporting. There can be no assurance that our independent registered public accounting firm
	will not identify material weaknesses which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

	months&#146; rent in advance. All other terms of the original lease are unchanged and remain in effect.

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are focused on becoming the world leader in novel antibiotics against infectious disease and on developing effective treatments for oral mucositis.
	We also develop, market, and sell proprietary probiotics specifically designed to enhance oral health for humans and pets, under the brand names Evora and ProBiora.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:18PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Our Antibiotic Product Candidate
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Members of our
	scientific team discovered that a certain bacterial strain produces MU1140, a molecule belonging to the novel class of antibiotics known as lantibiotics. Lantibiotics, such as MU1140, are highly modified peptide antibiotics made by a small group of
	Gram positive bacterial species. Approximately 60 lantibiotics have been discovered. We believe lantibiotics are generally recognized by the scientific community to be potent antibiotic agents.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In nonclinical testing, MU1140 has shown activity against all Gram positive bacteria against which it has been tested, including those responsible for a
	number of healthcare associated infections, or HAIs. A high percentage of hospital-acquired infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
	We believe the need for novel antibiotics is increasing as a result of the growing resistance of target pathogens to existing FDA approved antibiotics on the market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Lantibiotics have been difficult to investigate for their clinical usefulness as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of infectious diseases due to a general
	inability to produce or synthesize sufficient quantities of pure amounts of these molecules. Traditional fermentation methods can only produce minute amounts of the lantibiotic.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2012, we entered into the Lantibiotic Exclusive Channel Collaboration agreement (&#147;Lantibiotic ECC&#148;) with Intrexon Corporation
	(&#147;Intrexon&#148;) for the development and commercialization of the native strain of MU1140 and related homologs using Intrexon&#146;s advanced transgene and cell engineering platforms. Through our work with Intrexon, we have been able to
	produce a significant increase in the fermentation titer of MU1140 compared to standard fermentation methods and have discovered a new purification process for MU1140. Our work with Intrexon has generated a substantial number of homologs of MU1140,
	and we are continuing our research and development and collaboration efforts with Intrexon to develop potential derivatives of the MU1140 molecule using genetically modified bacteria.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our pre-clinical studies to support a potential Investigational New Drug (&#147;IND&#148;) filing with the FDA, we tested a total of six homologs of MU1140
	for certain compound characteristics, including but not limited to: drug activity (based on minimum inhibitory concentration or &#147;MIC&#148;) equal or better than &#147;standard of care&#148; drugs against certain drug-resistant bacteria, safety,
	toxicity, stability, and manufacturability. The study specifically evaluated homolog efficacy in relation to survival, measurable amounts of
<I>
	c. diff
</I>
	colony forming units, and toxin levels. Three homologs demonstrated promising results with
	one homolog, which is our current lead compound, achieving a 100% survival rate throughout the entire study in contrast to an approximately 30% survival rate for the vancomycin positive control.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have selected a lead candidate, OG253, and have had a pre IND meeting with the FDA in November of 2015. We will continue our research and development
	activities on OG253 and other potential homologs. Subject to sufficient available capital, we expect to file the IND for a first-in-human clinical study of OG253 in the second half of 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June of 2015, we
	entered into a worldwide Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (&#147;Oral Mucositis ECC&#148;) with Intrexon and Intrexon Actobiotics NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrexon, pursuant to which we obtained certain exclusive rights to AG013 as
	a potential treatment of oral mucositis, or OM, which we intend to continue to develop.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In a Phase 1b clinical trial in 25 cancer patients with OM, AG013
	was safe and well tolerated. Data published in the journal
<U>

</U>
	showed a 35% reduction of the duration of ulcerative OM in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, close to 30% of the patients treated

	homogeneous exposure to the entire mucosal surface up to 24 hours after administration of a rinse. During the first quarter of 2016, we conducted a confirmatory animal study on AG013. We will use the results from that confirmatory study as we move
	towards a meeting with the Food and Drug Administration with the goal of launching a Phase 2 trial on AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients. AG013 has been granted Orphan Drug status in the European Union and we
	believe it may be eligible for Biologic License Application exclusivity as well as Fast Track designation with the United States Food and Drug Administration.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are marketing a variety of
	probiotic products that we developed. Our probiotic products contain the active ingredient ProBiora3, a patented blend of oral care probiotics that promote fresher breath, whiter teeth and support overall oral health. We have conducted scientific
	studies on ProBiora3 in order to market our products under self-affirmed Generally Recognized As Safe status (&#147;GRAS&#148;). We have historically sold our ProBiora3 products through multiple distribution channels. We continue to seek improvement
	in the performance of our oral care probiotics products, to better serve our customers, and we continue to evaluate new delivery systems, which we believe will enable us to deliver ProBiora3 to new markets and end-users.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since initial commercialization of our ProBiora3 products we have attempted to improve market awareness and sales of our oral probiotic product line with
	limited success to date and we have reduced our marketing expenditures accordingly to focus more on lantibiotics. The allocation of limited financial resources between research and development of lantibiotics for our other product candidates and
	sale and marketing efforts for our ProBiora3 products, among other factors, resulted in our December 2014 announcement that we would seek to explore strategic alternatives for the probiotic business. These alternatives could include joint ventures,
	strategic partnerships or alliances, a sale of the probiotic products business or other possible transactions. There can be no assurance that a transaction or agreement, will be consummated with terms favorable to us, if at all.

	In addition to
	our lantibiotics and oral mucositis product candidates, we also have other candidates and technologies in the oral care and weight loss areas. We do not intend to continue to develop these potential product candidates and technologies without

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 we had
	an accumulated deficit of $87,655,968 and we have yet to achieve profitability. We incurred net losses of $11,711,333 and $5,789,519 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to incur significant and increasing
	operating losses for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our product candidates through nonclinical testing and clinical trials to ultimately obtain regulatory approval and eventual commercialization. We need to raise additional capital.
	The report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our financial statements appearing in our Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph stating that our operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, and our
	need to raise additional financing and/or financial support prior to June&nbsp;30, 2016 in order to continue to fund our operations, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that additional
	capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect that research and development expenses will increase along with general and
	administrative costs, as we grow and operate our business.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We were incorporated in November 1996 and commenced operations in 1999. We consummated our initial public offering in June 2003. We have devoted substantially
	all of our available resources to the commercialization of our ProBiora3 products as well as our discovery efforts comprising research and development, clinical trials for our product candidates, protection of our intellectual property and the
	general and administrative support of these operations. We have generated limited revenues from grants and ProBiora3 product sales through December&nbsp;31, 2015, and have principally funded our operations through the sale of debt and equity
	securities, including the exercise of warrants issued in connection with these financing transactions. Prior to 2008 our revenues were derived solely from research grants. Since 2008, our revenues have also included sales of our ProBiora3 products,
	which we initiated in late 2008. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, our net revenues were $1,175,841 and $939,926, respectively.

	successfully engage in marketing efforts related to our ProBiora3 products, which we have substantially scaled back. Our marketing efforts for our ProBiora3 products have had limited success to date as revenues have not significantly increased from
	period to period. We continue to consider options for marketing our ProBiora3 Products that can be cost-effective as we seek to manage the use of our cash resources relative to the research and development we are conducting for our other product

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect that our future revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the volume of sales of our products and the amount

	Our research and
	development expenses can be divided into (i)&nbsp;clinical research, and (ii)&nbsp;nonclinical research and development activities. Clinical research costs consist of clinical trials, manufacturing services, regulatory activities and related
	personnel costs, and other costs such as rent, utilities, depreciation and stock-based compensation. Nonclinical research and development costs consist of our research activities, nonclinical studies, related personnel costs and laboratory supplies,
	and other costs such as rent, utilities, depreciation and stock-based compensation and research expenses we incur associated with our ECC agreements with Intrexon. While we are currently focused on advancing our product development programs, our

	Our research and development expenses were $8,803,033 and $3,065,053 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in research
	and development expense for 2015 is the non-cash expense of $5,000,000 associated with an up-front payment of a technology access fee, consisting of the issuance of a convertible note to Intrexon for $5,000,000 in connection with the establishment
	of the Oral Mucositis ECC with Intrexon. The convertible note, including accrued interest, was repaid in December 2015 through the issuance of 3,381,004 shares of our common stock.

	Our current strategy is to increase our research and development expenses in the future as we continue the advancement of our clinical trials and nonclinical
	product development programs for our MU1140 product candidate and with respect to our oral mucositis product candidate. The lengthy process of completing clinical trials; seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates; and expanding the
	claims we are able to make, requires expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials, or in obtaining regulatory approvals, could cause a delay in generating product revenues and cause our research and
	development expenses to increase and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our current antibiotic product development candidate is not expected to be commercially available until we are able to obtain regulatory approval from
	the FDA, which is not expected before 2017.

	provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors, including industry data of product return rates, historical experience of actual returns, analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel, if any, and reorder
	rates. If the history or our product returns changes, the reserve will be adjusted. While we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances, applying different judgments to the

	Future Capital Requirements
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our capital requirements for 2016 will depend on numerous factors, including the success of our commercialization efforts and of our research and development,
	the resources we devote to develop and support our technologies and our success in pursuing strategic licensing and funded product development relationships with external partners. Subject to our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from our
	ProBiora3 products and our ability to raise additional capital including through possible joint ventures and/or partnerships, we expect to incur substantial expenditures to further commercialize or develop our technologies including continued
	increases in costs related to research, nonclinical testing and clinical studies, as well as costs associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company. We will require substantial funds to conduct research and development and
	nonclinical and Phase 1 clinical testing of our licensed, patented technologies and to develop sublicensing relationships for the Phase 2 and 3 clinical testing and manufacture and marketing of any products that are approved for commercial sale. Our
	plans include seeking both equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements with entities interested in our technologies, or other business transactions that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our
	operations and research and development programs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our current available cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements.
	We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will allow us to only fund our operating plan through June 2016. We expect to continue to seek additional funding for our operations. Any such required additional capital may not be available on
	reasonable terms, if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our planned clinical testing, research and development and commercialization activities,
	which could harm our business. The sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could
	have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We also will require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts. For example, as we continue to work with Intrexon under
	the Lantibiotic ECC for the development of MU1140 and in our new Oral Mucositis ECC, we will require additional capital.

	We

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $81,059,000 and $69,735,000,
	respectively, to offset future federal and state income taxes. We also have research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,708,000 and $1,355,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to offset future federal
	and state income taxes. Our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire if not used by 2035 and 2025, respectively. Any greater than 50% change in ownership under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue
	Code, or the Code, places significant annual limitations on the use of such net operating loss carryforwards and we exceeded the 50% threshold when we consummated the June 2009 private placement transaction with the Koski Family Limited Partnership,
	or KFLP, in June 2009. Subsequent to this event, we again exceeded the 50% threshold when we executed transactions with Intrexon in December 2013. As a result, our loss carryforwards incurred from July 2009 through December 2013 will be limited to
	approximately $3,540,000 per year. Our historical loss carryforwards through June 2009 will be limited to approximately $417,000 per year. We anticipate that this will effectively limit our ability to utilize our historical loss carryforwards
	through June 2009 to an aggregate amount of approximately $6,285,000 over such period of time, and the remaining balance of our historical loss carryforwards prior to June 2009 will expire unused. We also anticipate that this limitation will
	effectively cause all of our tax credit carryforwards through June 2009 to expire unused. We do not anticipate that the December 2013 limitation will cause any of our loss carryforwards or tax credits incurred July 2009 through December 2013 to
	expire unused. Provided that there are no future ownership changes that would trigger the limitations on loss carryforwards provided under the Code, the operating losses we experience after December 2013 are expected to add to our loss carryforwards
	and to be fully available to us.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of
	approximately $31,199,000 and $26,928,000, respectively, as our management believes it is uncertain that they will be fully realized. If we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net operating loss
	carryforwards, an adjustment to our net operating loss carryforwards would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Inflation affects the cost of raw materials,
	goods and services that we use. In recent years, inflation has been modest. However, high energy costs and fluctuations in commodity prices can affect the cost of all raw materials and components. The competitive environment somewhat limits our
	ability to recover higher costs resulting from inflation by raising prices. Although we cannot precisely determine the effects of inflation on our business, it is management&#146;s belief that the effects on revenues and operating results will not
	be significant. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented, except with respect to payroll-related costs and other costs arising from or related to government imposed
	regulations.

	Management&#146;s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s
	disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act was performed under the supervision and participation of our senior management, including our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer. The purpose of disclosure controls and procedures is to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
	periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
	disclosures. Based upon that evaluation, our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial; Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 in
	ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported with the time periods specified in the Securities and exchange Commission&#146;s rules
	and forms.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During 2011, we disclosed and identified several material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 we remediated all but one of the identified material weaknesses. The remaining material weakness related to a lack of adequate segregation of duties due to our small number of employees. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015, we analyzed our processes and systems. Based upon that analysis, we implemented during the fourth quarter several additional processes and system controls that lead us to conclude that we no longer have a lack of adequate segregation of
	duties. Management believes that the financial statements in our Annual Report on December&nbsp;31, 2015 Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in
	conformity with GAAP.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Management believes that, existing controls were effective and operating properly as designed. During 2015, management believes

	Except as indicated in the preceding paragraphs about management&#146;s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and
	internal controls, our management, with the participation of our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded there were no other significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our
	management, including our Interim Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
	operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
	considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,
	by collusion of two or more people, or by management or board override of the control.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
	certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
	in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The management of Oragenics, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
	in the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#146;s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of
	financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that,
	in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
	(iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no
	matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance
	with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
	with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management, under the supervision of the Interim Principal Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
	Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission (COSO) in
<I>
	Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992)&nbsp;
</I>
	as updated in May of 2013, (the &#147;2013 COSO Framework&#148;). We have integrated the changes prescribed by the 2013 COSO Framework into our internal controls over
	financial reporting during the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2015.&nbsp;We also used SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company&#146;s internal control over
	financial reporting was effective.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal
	control over financial reporting. Management&#146;s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management&#146;s
	report in this annual report.

	To the Board of Directors and

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Shareholders of Oragenics, Inc.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Oragenics, Inc. (the Company) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 and the related statements of
	operations, changes in shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
	internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
	opinion of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
	financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Oragenics, Inc. as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming Oragenics, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the
	Company has incurred recurring operating losses, negative operating cash flows and has an accumulated deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#146;s plans in
	regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
	that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	The accompanying financial

	the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from
	operations since inception.&nbsp;To date the Company has not generated significant revenues from operations.&nbsp;The Company generated revenues of $1,175,841, incurred a net loss of $11,711,333 and used cash of $5,104,385 in its operating
	activities during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $(87,655,968) and cash flows from operations were negative throughout 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During 2012, a significant source of debt and equity funding was provided by the Company&#146;s largest shareholder, the Koski Family Limited Partnership (the
	&#147;KFLP&#148;). In addition, in 2013 and 2012 the Company raised $14,900,000 and $13,000,000 in gross proceeds respectively through the sale of its common stock. The Company expects to incur substantial expenditures to further develop each of its
	technologies. The Company believes the working capital at December&nbsp;31, 2015 will be sufficient to meet the business objectives as presently structured through June&nbsp;2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s ability to continue operations after its current cash resources are exhausted depends on its ability to obtain additional financing or
	achieve profitable operations, as to which no assurances can be given. Cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in the Company&#146;s focus and direction of its research and development programs, competitive
	and technical advances, or other developments. Additional financing will be required to continue operations after the Company exhausts its current cash resources and to continue its long-term plans for clinical trials and new product development.
	There can be no assurance that any such financing can be realized by the Company, or if realized, what the terms thereof may be, or that any amount that the Company is able to raise will be adequate to support the Company&#146;s working capital
	requirements until it achieves profitable operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company intends to seek additional funding through sublicensing arrangements, joint venturing
	or partnering, sales of rights to technology, government grants and public or private financings. The Company&#146;s future success depends on its ability to raise capital and ultimately generate revenue and attain profitability. The Company cannot
	be certain that additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to it or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company issues
	additional securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of its common stock, and the Company&#146;s current shareholders may experience dilution. If the Company is unable to obtain funds
	when needed or on acceptable terms, the Company may be required to curtail their current development programs, cut operating costs and forego future development and other opportunities.

	In
	August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s Ability to
	Continue as a Going Concern.&#148; ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management&#146;s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote
	disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the
	financial statements are issued. Management will also be required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within annual
	periods ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2014-15 and has not yet determined its impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May&nbsp;2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance on Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to clarify the principles used to
	recognize revenue for all entities. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
	expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Additionally, the guidance requires disaggregated disclosures related to the
	nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The FASB has subsequently delayed this standard by one year. Early adoption is
	permitted as of the original effective date.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
	assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are anticipated milestone payments, stock based compensation, valuation of warrants, income tax valuation allowance, inventory obsolescence reserve, sales returns and
	allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts.

	The Company has granted guaranteed rights of return to two dental distributor customer accounts. The Company defers recognition of revenue on these accounts
	until the customer provides notification to the Company that the product has been sold to the end consumer or the guaranteed right of return period expires. Once notification has been received and verified, the Company records revenue in that
	accounting period. The Company had $14,215 and $21,222 of revenue deferred under guaranteed rights of return arrangements included in deferred revenue in the balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

	Accounts receivable are recorded at their net realizable value and consist of trade receivables from the sale of product to customers. We analyze accounts
	receivable on a monthly basis and determine the collectability based on the facts and circumstances relating to each customer. The Company estimates their allowance for doubtful accounts based on sales trend and specific review of the

	that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value, inventory in excess of expected sales requirements, or inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications. Expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are
	written off to the reserve for inventory obsolescence. The inventory reserve at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $60,660 and $50,100, respectively.

	awards&#146; grant date typically using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at the fair value of the stock-based payment. The expense resulting from stock-based
	payments are recorded in research and development expense or selling, general and administrative expense in the statement of operations, depending on the nature of the services provided. Stock-based payment expense is recorded over the requisite
	service period in which the grantee provides services to us. To the extent the stock option grants, warrants, or restricted stock grants do not vest at the grant date they are subject to forfeiture.

	US GAAP requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their
	fair values as of the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period in which the grantee provides services to us, to the extent the options do not vest at the grant date and are subject to forfeiture. For
	performance-based awards that do not include market-based conditions, we record share-based compensation expense only when the performance-based milestone is deemed probable of achievement. We utilize both quantitative and qualitative criteria to
	judge whether milestones are probable of achievement. For awards with market-based performance conditions, we recognize the grant-date fair value of the award over the derived service period regardless of whether the underlying performance condition
	is met.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sales as a reduction of revenues as such allowances can be reliably
	estimated based on historical experience or known trends.&nbsp;We maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period of time prior to and subsequent to the expiration date of the product. The estimate of
	the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors, including industry data of product return rates, historical experience of actual returns, analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel, if any, and
	reorder rates. If the history or our product returns changes, the reserve will be adjusted. While the Company believes that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances, applying
	different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns and chargebacks to vary. Because our ProBiora3 products have only recently been introduced, we could experience different circumstances
	in the future and these differences could be material.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has granted guaranteed rights of return at various times to certain customers. At this

	has sold to the end consumer. Once notification has been received and verified, the Company will record revenue in that accounting period.

	Income taxes are accounted for under the
	asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
	and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
	income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
	Deferred tax assets are reduced to estimated amounts expected to be realized by the use of a valuation allowance. Based on our historical operating losses, a valuation allowance has been recognized for all deferred tax assets.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under US GAAP, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not
	to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, US GAAP provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
	interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company originally adopted the Oragenics, Inc. 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the &#147;Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) on
	September&nbsp;17, 2002. The Stock Incentive Plan was amended to increase the available shares in May&nbsp;2004, May 2006, April 2008, October 2009, and on August 29, 2011. On October&nbsp;23, 2012, the Stock Incentive plan was amended and restated
	as our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;2012 Incentive Plan&#148;). The 2012 Incentive Plan, as amended and restated has authorized 4,000,000 shares for issuance. To date, 1,877,462 shares have been issued under the 2012 Incentive Plan. As a
	result of such issuances as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 there is currently an aggregate of 2,122,538 shares available for issuance under the 2012 Incentive Plan, of which 1,471,031 shares are covered by outstanding option awards and 651,507 shares are
	available for future awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The purpose of the 2012 Incentive Plan is to advance the interests of the Company by affording
	certain employees and directors of the Company and key consultants and advisors an opportunity to acquire or increase their proprietary interests in the Company. The 2012 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of stock options (incentive and
	non-statutory), stock appreciation rights and restricted stock. Options are granted at the fair market value of the Company&#146;s stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a period of two to three years from their respective grant
	dates and expire 10 years from the date of grant. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had not awarded any stock appreciation rights under the 2012 Incentive Plan.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Recipients of stock awards under our 2012 Incentive Plan become the owner of record of the stock immediately upon grant, which may be subject to certain
	restrictions. The balance of unvested restricted stock will be forfeited and automatically transferred back to us at no cost upon the termination of the recipient&#146;s employment. Upon vesting of restricted stock or in connection with our LTIP
	awards which vest immediately that are made to recipients who are employees, the recipient has the option to settle minimum withholding taxes by electing to have us withhold otherwise deliverable shares having a fair market value equal to the
	required tax obligations (&#147;net-settlement&#148;). The net-settlement shares are then immediately cancelled and retired and reduce the shares available for issuance under the Company&#146;s 2012 Incentive Plan. There were no stock awards to
	employees in 2015 and 2014 and as such, no shares were withheld.

	On June 9, 2015, the Company
	entered into an ECC with Intrexon and Intrexon Actobiotics NV (&#147;Actobiotics&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrexon, through which the Company intends to research, develop and commercialize products, including the continued development
	and commercialization of AG013, for use in the treatment of oral mucositis in humans and/or the administration to humans of a trefoil factor via genetically modified bacteria (including
<I>

	of the oral cavity, throat, and esophagus, but, in any case, excluding the delivery of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer (collectively, the &#147;Program&#148;). Contemporaneously with the ECC, the Company
	and Intrexon also entered into a Stock Issuance Agreement (the &#147;SIA&#148;) which authorized the issuance of the Technology Access Fee and the future stock issuance of our Common Stock to Intrexon upon the achievement of designated milestones.
	The ECC governs the &#147;channel collaboration&#148; arrangement in which we will use Intrexon&#146;s proprietary technology relating to the identification, design and production of genetically modified bacteria (the &#147;Technology&#148;) for the
	purpose of developing the Program. The ECC provides for the establishment of committees comprised from us and Intrexon representatives that will govern activities in the areas of project establishment, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical
	and regulatory matters, commercialization efforts, and intellectual property.

	to the regulatory approval of AG013, including regulatory filings, data, clinical trial reports, and rights thereunder. Under the Oral Mucositis ECC, and subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for, among other things, funding the further

	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
	portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
	Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the levels of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable
	income over which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will not be able to realize the benefits of some of these deductible differences.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $31,199,403 and $26,927,920 has been provided in the accompanying financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	2014, respectively. The 2015 net change in valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets was an increase of $4,271,483 primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards. The 2014 net change in valuation allowance related to deferred tax
	assets was an increase of $2,052,871 primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has federal and state
	tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $81,059,000. The federal and state tax loss carryforward will expire through 2035, unless previously utilized. The Company also has federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of
	approximately $1,708,000. The federal tax credit carryforward will expire through 2025, unless previously utilized.

	Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service
	Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the Company&#146;s net operating losses and credit carryforwards are limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% that occurred in 2009 and in 2013. As a result of these 50% changes in ownership,
	the annual amount of pre-change net operating losses that may be used in periods subsequent to the change in ownership is approximately $417,000 for losses incurred through June&nbsp;2009, and $3,540,000 for losses incurred through
	December&nbsp;2013. The impact of this limitation is factored into management&#146;s valuation allowance placed against the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets.

	For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred $353,814 and $112,871, respectively, of additional unrecognized tax benefits that

	royalty payments, and a one-time cumulative royalty payment. The one-time commercialization fee would be due on the first anniversary of first commercial sale and is calculated at $5,000 per month between (1)&nbsp;April&nbsp;1, 2013 for the MU1140
	license agreement and (2)&nbsp;the month of the first anniversary of a commercial sale. The post-commercialization minimum royalty payments of $50,000 annually would be due following payment of a commercialization fee. The one-time additional
	royalty payment would be due when total cumulative royalties paid to UFRF exceed $2.0 million, upon which we would be obligated to make a one-time additional payment to UFRF of 10% of the total royalties due to UFRF in the calendar year in which

	and expenses incurred by the UFRF for the preparation, filing, prosecution, issuance and maintenance of the patents.

	than three calendar quarters. The Company may voluntarily terminate the license agreement upon 90 days written notice to UFRF. UFRF may terminate the amended license agreement if the Company breaches its obligations to timely pay any amounts due
	under the amended license agreement, to submit development reports as required under the amended license agreement or commit any other breach of any other covenants contained in the amended license agreement and the Company fails to remedy such
